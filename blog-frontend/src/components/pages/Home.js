    sinopsis: "Beneath the surface of every marriage there are secrets. This one is deadly. My husband is lying. The minute he came home with alcohol on his breath and unable to look me in the eyes I knew it. We used to be in love – the intense ‘I can’t be without you for a second’ kind. Where it hurts deep to be apart. But now, we’re the couple that keep secrets from each other. We hide the truth. He thought I wouldn’t find out. I’m a detective – it’s literally my job to uncover clues and solve mysteries. I know what he did. And now I’m sitting here, in a police interview, being asked the question ‘did you kill her?’ to which I utter one life-shattering ‘yes.’",

    review: "Fantastic! From the opening scene, I knew this one was a keeper. They always say no one knows what is happening in a marriage and this story proves it. A woman has been murdered and a detective is trying to find out who did it. Rowan Velky, a local detective, and her partner, Kellan Palmer are the first detectives to enter a gruesome crime. Who is behind the killing? Why? Nothing else should be said about this one. The less you know the more entertained you will be. Did I guess the big reveal, yep from the get-go but I don't feel like it took away any of my enjoyment. The end was great! Amanda McKinney is now on my radar.",

    sinopsis: "Lark Smith has always had a plan for her life: find a fantastic guy, create a marriage as blissful as her parents’, pop out a couple of kids and build a rewarding career as an oncologist. Things aren’t going so well. For one, the guy didn’t work out. Theoretically, she’d love to find someone else, but it hasn’t happened. Two, she’s just been transferred out of oncology for being too emotional. (Is it her fault she’s a weeper?) Three, her parents just split up. Deviating from the plan was…well, not in the plan. A potential solution comes from the foul-tempered and renowned surgeon Lorenzo Santini (aka Dr. Satan). He needs a date this summer for his sister’s wedding. His ancient Noni wants to see him settled. In exchange, he could make a few introductions and maybe get Lark back into the field of her choice. As a sucker for old people and fake relationships, Lark agrees. Teeny problem—she instantly falls for his big, warm family. Especially his estranged brother. Meanwhile, Lark’s mom has moved in with Lark’s flamboyant landlady, Joy, and an unlikely friendship blossoms. The three women have a long summer and a big beautiful house on the ocean to figure out what’s next…and quite possibly learn that the best things in life aren’t planned at all.",

    review: "Look on the Bright Side had me tearing up by the end! Lark Smith is rotating through oncology when she's told she will be sent to rotate through the ER instead because she gets too emotional with her patients. Yet, the only thing she wants is to become an oncologist, so when Dr. Lorenzo 'Satan' Santini offers her an exchange she decides to accept it. Dr. Satan needs a date for the next three months to convince his dying grandmother that he is not alone. If Lark says yes, he will call his connections to get her closer to an oncology position. The last thing Lark was expecting was to fall for his family and for his brother, Dante. Chapter by chapter, we start discovering what happened to Lark and why she has an obsession with oncology. At the same time, we also get two more POVs. One is Lark's mother Ellie. The other one is Joy, Lark's landlady. The summer will be a summer of growth for all three. Look on the Bright Side is a woman's fiction novel with a side of romance. It is also about loss, healing, and self-discovery. As always, Kristan Higgins writes an emotional ride that I can't help but enjoy.",

He might be able to hear me even after the terrible accident that left him fighting for his life. But all I have to whisper to my husband is I know what you did. Every day I wave my husband Damon off with a kiss and a smile, drive our precious children to school, and make sure our house is pristine before preparing a delicious meal. I pretend I’m not filled with fury that he once nearly destroyed our perfect life. It’s important to carry on as normal. That is, until the accident. My husband was hit by a car. It was pouring with rain. Nobody saw what happened. But the police are asking questions… Do they know about the terrible argument we had that day?

    sinopsis: "From New York Times bestseller Elle Cosimano comes Finlay Donovan Rolls the Dice―the fiercely anticipated next installment in the beloved Finlay Donovan series. Finlay Donovan and her nanny/partner-in-crime Vero are in sore need of a girls’ weekend away. They plan a trip to Atlantic City, but odds are―seeing as it’s actually a cover story to negotiate a deal with a dangerous loan shark, save Vero’s childhood crush Javi, and hunt down a stolen car―it won’t be all fun and games. When Finlay’s ex-husband Steven and her mother insist on tagging along too, Finlay and Vero suddenly have a few too many meddlesome passengers along for the ride. Within hours of arriving in their seedy casino hotel, it becomes clear their rescue mission is going to be a bust. Javi’s kidnapper, Marco, refuses to negotiate, demanding payment in full in exchange for Javi’s life. But that’s not all―he insists on knowing the whereabouts of his missing nephew, Ike, who mysteriously disappeared. Unable to confess what really happened to Ike, Finlay and Vero are forced to come up with a new plan: sleuth out the location of Javi and the Aston Martin, then steal them both back. But when they sneak into the loan shark’s suite to search for clues, they find more than they bargained for―Marco's already dead. They don’t have a clue who murdered him, only that they themselves have a very convincing motive. Then four members of the police department unexpectedly show up in town, also looking for Ike―and after Finlay's night with hot cop Nick at the police academy, he’s a little too eager to keep her close to his side. If Finlay can juggle a jealous ex-husband, two precocious kids, her mother’s marital issues, a decomposing loan shark, and find Vero’s missing boyfriend, she might get out of Atlantic City in one piece. But will she fold under the pressure and come clean about the things she’s done, or be forced to double down?",

    review: "I swear this series is much funnier if you listen to the audiobooks! I didn't think I was going to enjoy this one as much as the first Finlay book but surprisingly, I did. I  had so much fun with it. I recommend reading this series in order. By the end of Finlay Donovan Rolls the Dice. It felt like an arc had ended. So I'm excited about next Finlay's adventure. This novel begins with Finlay and Vero planning to travel to Atlantic City to find Javi and the Aston Martin but their girls' weekend becomes complicated when they can't leave alone. Finlay's ex-husband Steven, her children, and her mother are all coming with them. Their trip became even more complicated when the cops showed up. I loved the emerging Finlay. The character continues to evolve and is becoming more assertive. I also love her friendship with Vero. They are a great duo. I look forward to reading the next one. ",

    sinopsis: "From the New York Times bestselling author of The Wind Knows My Name comes a mesmerizing tale of two passionate souls who share one magical night that defies all rational explanation. Love, be it wild or tender, often defies logic. In fact, at times, the only rationale behind the instant connection of two souls is plain magic. Bibiña Aranda, runaway bride, wakes up in the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao still wearing her wedding dress, draped in the loving arms of a naked man whose name she doesn’t know. She and the man with no clothes, Indar Zubieta, attempt to explain to the authorities how they got there. It’s a story of love at first sight and experience beyond compare, one that involves a dreamlike journey through the museum. But the lovers’ transcendent night bears no resemblance to the crude one Detective Larramendi attempts to reconstruct. And no amount of fantastical descriptions can convince the irritated inspector of the truth. Allende’s dreamy short story has the power to transport readers in any language, leaving them to ponder the wonders of love long after the story’s over.",

They are found one morning in the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao after a night of passion. A detective is called to investigate the break-in. Everyone is stupefied. How did the couple get into the museum? How did they evade the security guards? They didn't even know each other or their names!! Was there magic involved? A short story by a great author!

Which is why when I needed to travel to Montana to help my brother, I intended to go by myself.But I’m not alone anymore.Together, Adam and I find ourselves trapped with strangers in a lodge in the heart of the wilderness, in the teeth of a storm of legendary power, only to discover my brother’s issues are a tiny part of a problem much bigger than we could have imagined.

    review: "Action-packed winter storm! For the hard-core readers of this series, this installment doesn't disappoint. Mercy is still recuperating from the attack she suffered in the last book. She is not doing well. Her mind and her magic were affected by the Soul Taker. No one really knows how to fix her. Adam knows she is not well but no one he knows can help her. Then, Mercy's half-brother, Gary shows up. He is unable to talk or comprehend. Something happened to him while he was taking care of a ranch in Montana. Despite her own problems, Mercy knows she has to help him. Mercy and Adam decide to take a trip to Montana to find the answers. Their trip is not an easy one. The winter storm is a powerful one. Someone is behind it. But why? By whom? As they arrive at the Lounge, they are met by a wedding party. It's not a typical one. Mercy and Adam come to the realization that more than Gary's life is in danger. I love Mercy and Adam together. They have learned to trust each other and to let the other be independent when the right occasion arises. My one complaint is that I missed the rest of the pack and I also miss Bran.",

    sinopsis: "When an anonymous neighborhood forum gets hacked, the darkest secrets of New York’s wealthiest residents come to light—including some worth killing for—in this gripping suspense novel from the author of Just One Look. It was all confidential. Right up to the moment when it wasn’t. UrbanMyth: It was lauded as an alternative to the performative, show-your-best-self platforms—an anonymous discussion board grouped by zip code. The residents of Manhattan’s exclusive Upper East Side disclosed it all, things they would never share with their friends or their spouses: secret bank accounts, steamy affairs, tidbits of juicy gossip. These are the same parents who would go to astonishing lengths to ensure their children gain admission to the most prestigious boarding schools and universities. So when a “hacktivist” group breaks into the forum and exposes the real identity behind each poster, the repercussions resound down Park Avenue with a force none could have anticipated. And someone will end up dead. Will it be Heather, the outsider who would do anything to get her daughter into the elite’s good graces and into even better schools? Norah, the high-powered suit failing to balance work and the emotional responsibilities of motherhood? Or Poppy, perfect on the outside but hiding more than her share of secrets? Each of them has something to hide. Each of them will do anything to keep their secrets hidden. And each of them just might kill to protect their own.",

    review: "Entertaining for sure! There are 3 main female characters. Heather: she is relentless in trying to get her daughter into an elite boarding school. She will stop at nothing to accomplish it. Poppy: Rich and full of privilege. Yet, she is bored. Her husband treats her like a decoration he purchased and is showing off. Norah: a down-to-earth mother who works for Poppy's husband. She works and enjoys it and doesn't feel like she fits with all the other mothers which she is happy about. Then there is a website called Urban Myth. The website is supposed to be private. Everyone can post their deepest secrets. The information is so juicy that everyone on the Upper East Side has the app. Then, a man disappears and the site is hacked and all three ladies' secrets are in the open. I think the blurb is misleading. The hacking happens not at the beginning of the book but way into it. By then, I don't think it made much of a difference. We already knew each woman and what they were dealing with privately. No One Needs to Know had unlikable characters except for Norah. She was my favorite. I enjoyed the ending and I would recommend this book to anyone who would like to read something like Desperate Housewives. I certainly do.",

Maddie West is shaken to the core when she finds out that everything she believed about her life was a lie. Her parents had always planned to tell her the truth about her past: that she was adopted as an embryo. But somehow the right moment never happened. Now, the total stranger who confronts Maddie with the truth tells her something else that rocks her world—Maddie had a sister she never knew about. Feeling betrayed, angry, and confused, Maddie leaves her new job and fiancé, rejects her family’s requests for forgiveness, and moves to Portland, Oregon, to find out who she really is. Dawson Gage’s life is destroyed when London Quinn, the only girl he had ever loved, is killed. In the hospital waiting room, London’s mother reveals to Dawson that London might have had a sibling—the frozen embryo she and her husband donated decades ago. When Dawson invites Maddie to Portland to connect with her long-lost relatives, the Quinns, her biological parents, welcome her into their lives. Maddie is intrigued by their memories of London, who was so much like her. Is this the family and the life she was really meant to have? Now it will take the love of Dawson Gage to help Maddie find her way home.",

    review: "So I was scrolling through my feed and saw that a movie based on this book was coming out. I downloaded the audio but had no clue this book is the 30th in this series! I know I probably missed a lot since I don't know the rest of the characters well. The second thing, I didn't know was that it was a Christian book. Anyway, back to the story. Maddie West is excited to start her new job at the zoo after graduating college. She also is about to get married. Her fiancee seems to be a really sweet guy. Then, Dawson Gage finds Maddie at the zoo and tells her that she is adopted and that London, her biological sister, and her parents live in Portland. At first, Maddie believes he is a liar but after one conversation with her parents, she realizes he was telling her the truth. Maddie decides to leave it all and go to Portland to find out more about her sister and her biological parents. I ended up liking the book but did have some issues with Maddie's decisions. First, leaving her job, her parents, and her fiancee abruptly without a good conversation felt wrong to me. Second, I'm not sure what new job will let you leave it for an unknown period of time just after your first day and they will hold it for you. Third, the way she refused to talk to her adoptive family despite all that they had done for her felt very childish. Lastly, the big decision she made in Portland that will affect her for the rest of her life felt very rushed. I'm not saying it was not the right one, but she didn't discuss it with the people who cared about her. She just informed them about her decision.",

When a woman slides into his DMs with the same problem, they come up with a plan: They'll date each other and break up. Their curses will cancel each other’s out, and they’ll both go on to find the love of their lives. It’s a bonkers idea… and it just might work. Emma hadn't planned that her next assignment as a traveling nurse would be in Minnesota, but she and her best friend agree that dating Justin is too good of an opportunity to pass up, especially when they get to rent an adorable cottage on a private island on Lake Minnetonka. It's supposed to be a quick fling, just for the summer. But when Emma's toxic mother shows up and Justin has to assume guardianship of his three siblings, they're suddenly navigating a lot more than they expected–including catching real feelings for each other. What if this time Fate has actually brought the perfect pair together?",
    imageR: mrsleifReview,
    review: "Another powerful book written by Abby Jimenez.After finding a post on Reddit, Emma decides to DM a message to Justin. Justin's post on Reddit is quite funny. The gist of the post is that after leaving him, every woman he dates, then they go on to find their true love. Emma is surprised because the exact same thing has happened to her, so she tells him that in her message. After a few interactions through texts and then video, Justin tries to convince her to come to Minnesota so they can date and then break up. Hoping that both can find their true love after. Emma is a traveling nurse and when her current job ends, she convinces her best friend and roommate to go to Minnesota with her. Emma and Justin have tons of chemistry and their relationship progresses wonderfully. There were just a couple of issues: Emma's mother is back in the picture and dating her boss. Emma's mother was not a good mother. She abandoned Emma as a child and Emma was raised in foster care. The second issue was that due to unfortunate circumstances, Justin was soon becoming the guardian of his three siblings. I did love this story. So much heart! There is a lot of pain and at times, it was hard to like Emma. Justin on the other hand, was perfect. He was very understanding and supportive. I can't wait for her next book. Cliffhanger: No",

It’s been years since that horrible night, a night Lucy can’t remember anything about, and she has since moved to LA and started a new life. But now the phenomenally huge hit true crime podcast `Listen for the Lie`, and its too-good looking host Ben Owens, have decided to investigate Savvy’s murder for the show’s second season. Lucy is forced to return to the place she vowed never to set foot in again to solve her friend’s murder, even if she is the one that did it.",

    review: "A favorite of 2024! Lucy is living in LA when she is fired from her job. She also knows her current relationship must come to an end. She sees no future with him. She knows the main reason is that finally, her past has come back to haunt her. In her small hometown of Texas, everyone believes she killed her best friend Savvy. She was found with Savvy's blood but Lucy has absolutely no memory of the event. The local police were unable to prove she killed Savvy. After, Savvy's death Lucy divorces her husband and she moves away to begin a new life. Now, a podcast called Listen to the Lie by Ben Owens is bringing it all back. When her grandmother calls and tells her to return to Texas for her birthday, Lucy can't say no. Her grandmother has been the one person who has always believed in her. When she arrives, her grandmother convinces her to talk to Ben. At first, Lucy doesn't want anything to do with the podcast but she is done running. She wants the truth to come out even if the truth is that she is the one responsible for Savvy's death. Listen for the Lie had a great female character. Lucy was extremely likable because she felt real. She didn't show as a damaged drunk or addicted to some type of drug like many of the other female characters in so many plots lately. I liked that we didn't know if she was guilty because she didn't remember it either. We were constantly guessing about the culprit. I did guess who it was but not from the start. I want to read whatever is next for Amy Tintera.",

    review: "A sweet story with sweet characters! Kate Shaw is done being angry. She has quit her job as a teacher and has decided to finally use her kitchen to make pancakes. Her husband passed away three years earlier and she knows she needs to move forward. He was a great cook and she misses him dearly and all the special dishes he used to make for them. While she's attempting to cook, someone knocks at her door. The old man's name is Charles and he tells her, her house used to be a tea place. His wife Mary and he used to enjoy many afternoons there. He wonders if she would cook something for his Mary. After talking with Charles for a while, Kate finds herself saying yes. She will cook scones for them. Next, Kate bumps into her neighbor, Della. Della is divorced and her faithful companion is her dog. They start a conversation and soon Kate invites Della to the meal she is preparing for Mary and Charles.

However, Kate soon learns what happened to Jack to make him react the way he did. The Secret Ingredient gives us a little bit of everything. There is loss, there is sadness but there is also hope, friendship, and memories. Food is a great memory inducer. A certain food smell can trigger a wonderful memory of someone you loved who has cooked for you. A food memory can also be comforting. I know it happens to me when I get sick and I just want to smell my mother's chicken soup recipe. I haven't tried any of the recipes in this book but I want to.",

But in Maggie's world, book rules are made to be broken. And what better way to break tradition than by starting an underground book club. But keeping her new club quiet, selling forbidden books and dodging the strict literary society is proving harder than it seems.

    review: "An enjoyable story that takes place in a bookstore. Maggie Banks is drifting. She is unsure about her future and the right path to follow so when her good friend offers her a job at her bookstore while she goes on maternity leave, she jumps at the chance. When Maggie starts working, she realizes she has a few issues. She has never been a reader. Also, the bookstore wasn't allowed to sell books from this century or the last! Third, the local historical society is trying to control everything the bookstore is doing. Maggie becomes desperate. She needs a plan. She can't afford to lose this job. She can't let her friend down either. What to do? Maggie realizes the only way she can stay afloat is to develop a secret book club where she can sell the books people want to read without getting discovered by her friend, the historical society, or the guy she had developed feelings for. I had some anxiety with this one. I wasn't sure how she could save the bookstore or her romance when the truth came out. The ending did feel a little too perfect but I'm not complaining.",

    sinopsis: "Lucy Sharpe is larger than life. Magnetic, addictive. Bold and dangerous. Especially for Margot, who meets Lucy at the end of their freshman year at a liberal arts college in South Carolina. Margot is the shy one, the careful one, always the sidekick and never the center of attention. But when Lucy singles her out at the end of the year, a year Margot spent studying and playing it safe, and asks her to room together, something in Margot can't say no—something daring, or starved, or maybe even envious. And so Margot finds herself living in an off-campus house with three other girls, Lucy, the ringleader; Sloane, the sarcastic one; and Nicole, the nice one, the three of them opposites but also deeply intertwined. It's a year that finds Margot finally coming out of the shell she's been in since the end of high school, when her best friend Eliza died three weeks after graduation. Margot and Lucy have become the closest of friends, but by the middle of their sophomore year, one of the fraternity boys from the house next door has been brutally murdered... and Lucy Sharpe is missing without a trace. A tantalizing thriller about the nature of friendship and belonging, about loyalty, envy, and betrayal—another gripping novel from an author quickly becoming the gold standard in psychological suspense.",

    review: "Margot lost her best friend Eliza due to an accident three weeks after graduating high school. Their plan had been to go together to college in South Carolina. Margo decides to do just that but her first year doesn't bring her any happiness, she is barely living. Then, Lucy Sharpe appears out of nowhere and offers Margot to move in with her and her two besties, Sloane and Nicole to an off-campus house and she doesn't hesitate to accept the offer. Lucy is magnetic. Everyone is interested in her and what she has to say. People gravitate towards her just like they did with Eliza. Margo is no exception. Like moths to light, Margo will follow Lucy's lead into everything but will this include murder? By the middle of sophomore year, a freshman fraternity boy has been brutally murdered and Lucy has gone missing.... The novel is narrated in past and present chapters. I loved A Flicker in the Dark and All the Dangerous Things but Only If You're Lucky felt short for this reader. I don't know if it was the unbelievable conclusion or me guessing the conclusion very early on. I was disappointed, to say the least. I wish this wasn't the case.

Home alone with her young children during a blizzard, a mother tucks her son back into bed in the middle of the night. She hears a noise—old houses are always making some kind of noise. But this sound is disturbingly familiar: it’s the tread of footsteps, unusually heavy and slow, coming up the stairs. She sees the figure of a man appear down the hallway, shrouded in the shadows. Terrified, she quietly wakes her children and hustles them into the oldest part of the house, a tiny, secret room concealed behind a wall. There they hide as the man searches for them, trying to tempt the children out with promises and scare the mother into surrender. In the suffocating darkness, the mother struggles to remain calm, to plan. Should she search for a weapon or attempt escape? But then she catches another glimpse of him. That face. That voice. And at once she knows her situation is even more dire than she’d feared, because she knows exactly who he is—and what he wants.",

She makes a run for it and wakes up her son and daughter and takes them to a secret space where she hopes he can't find them. Who is the man? Do they know him? Why are they the targets? Or is the mother imagining it all or is she the one who is trying to hurt her children? The story started with an intense bang and held my attention for a bit. Yet, by the middle, it lost some of its luster but the end brought the sense of urgency back which helped. The downside I would say had to do with the story being told from a third point of view and the ridiculous name given to the bad guy.",

    review: "Enjoyed this paranormal romance! Jillian Negat is unable to speak to men which makes it really hard to date them. Her life in NYC is not easy. She loves her job but she might not be able to keep it for too long since her column is about dating and she has no clue how to do that. Yes, she has gone on hundreds of dates but without being able to articulate you can guess how things haven't worked for her. Jillian believes in not changing and that people should love you the way you are and she will stick to this no matter what. Due to her poor finances, she moves into a tiny apartment full of mirrors and a ghost. Daniel is the ghost. He is sexy, shirtless, six-pack-wielding man. Too bad he is not alive! It takes little time for Daniel to guess that the reason Jillian can see him is that he needs to help her find a good relationship. Yet, the more time they spend together the harder is for Daniel to see her with other men and for Jillian not to compare every new man she meets to her ghost. They both understand the limitations of their relationship are obvious so how can it work? Warm and sweet is the best way to describe this story. I'm excited this is a series and I already know that I'll read the second book since I already like the protagonist. ",

    review: "Virgil Flowers is called to investigate a crime. A young man has been found dead in his cell of an apparent suicide after hitting a farmer with a baseball bat and then, the cop who worked that night is found dead at home with his pants unzipped. Virgil's companion in this investigation is Warren County Sheriff Lee Coakley. She won the recent election and has to prove she can solve this series of crimes after the bodies start piling up. A 'church' is in the middle of the investigation. Is sex the reason for the murders or is it child abuse? I think that John Sandford has made Virgil better and better with each book. The sarcasm, the perfect one-liners, the plot, and the secondary characters crossing over from the Lucas Davenport series all make a perfect winning formula for this novel to be engrossing and successful. Despite Virgil and Lucas being very different physically and in their personal life, they both share some qualities that humanize them.  Their gray areas are so very entertaining.",

She’s spent her life studying, obsessing over, and writing romantic comedies—good ones! That win contests! But she’s also been the sole caretaker for her kind-hearted dad, who needs full-time care. Now, when she gets a chance to re-write a script for famous screenwriter Charlie Yates—The Charlie Yates! Her personal writing god!—it’s a break too big to pass up. Emma’s younger sister steps in for caretaking duties, and Emma moves to L.A. for six weeks for the writing gig of a lifetime. But what is it they say? Don’t meet your heroes? Charlie Yates doesn’t want to write with anyone—much less “a failed, nobody screenwriter.” Worse, the romantic comedy he’s written is so terrible it might actually bring on the apocalypse. Plus! He doesn’t even care about the script—it’s just a means to get a different one green-lit. Oh, and he thinks love is an emotional Ponzi scheme. But Emma’s not going down without a fight. She will stand up for herself, and for rom-coms, and for love itself. She will convince him that love stories matter—even if she has to kiss him senseless to do it. But . . . what if that kiss is accidentally amazing? What if real life turns out to be so much . . . more real than fiction?

However, now her sister is coming back home after graduating and Emma gets the opportunity of a lifetime. She is asked to 'fix' Charlie Yates's new rom-com. She just needs to leave home and fly to LA for six weeks to do it. Emma has her work cut out for her. Charlie Yates doesn't want help with his rom-com. He only wrote it to be able to get another project approved. He doesn't believe in rom-coms. He doesn't believe in love period. Changing his mind is going to take all of Emma's time. Will she be able to do it? I love Emma. She was down-to-earth, half-full-glass type of person. She was sweet and a nice daughter. It took me longer to love Charlie. He was so standoffish at the beginning and it did bother me when he rejected Emma time after time. Yet, I ended up loving him. Another favorite from Katherine Center. I hope she writes many more.",

How they met (on a blustery day), fell in love (over an errant hat), and moved back to his lakeside hometown to begin their life together. He really was good at telling it…right up until the moment he realized he was actually in love with his childhood best friend Petra. Which is how Daphne begins her new story: Stranded in beautiful Waning Bay, Michigan, without friends or family but with a dream job as a children’s librarian (that barely pays the bills), and proposing to be roommates with the only person who could possibly understand her predicament: Petra’s ex, Miles Nowak. Scruffy and chaotic—with a penchant for taking solace in the sounds of heart break love ballads—Miles is exactly the opposite of practical, buttoned up Daphne, whose coworkers know so little about her they have a running bet that she’s either FBI or in witness protection. The roommates mainly avoid one another, until one day, while drowning their sorrows, they form a tenuous friendship and a plan. If said plan also involves posting deliberately misleading photos of their summer adventures together, well, who could blame them? But it’s all just for show, of course, because there’s no way Daphne would actually start her new chapter by falling in love with her ex-fiancé’s new fiancée’s ex…right?",
    imageR: mrsleifReview,
    review: "This is my favorite book by Emily Henry! Daphne thought she had found the stable home life she had sought. Her fiancee, Peter, and her home in Waning Bay, Michigan is all perfect to her. Peter is reliable and her job as a librarian has been a dream. Then, the next day after his bachelor's party, Peter walks in and tells her that he just realized that he is madly in love with his childhood friend, Petra and he is taking her to the Amalfi Coast to start their life together. He also gives Daphne a week to move out of his house. Daphne feels stranded. She has no friends or family close by. She doesn't have a place to stay until she finds Miles, Petra's ex-boyfriend who is also devastated by the news. Ever the practical, Daphne asked if she could be his roommate now that Petra was gone. What starts as a devastating situation for both, glues them together. They opened up about themselves and accepted each other just the way they were. From friends to maybe something even better. But can it work when they are so different? So many things to love about this book. The main characters were both great. Daphne from being a little stiff to morphing into someone who accepts change and learning to trust that not everyone walks away. Miles is a selfless, humble, and sexy guy who is on my book-boyfriend list of all time. The secondary characters were delightful in their own quirkiness, the fictional town of Waning made me think about moving there, and of course, the library sounded like a dream I wanted to visit. I loved this one and I was so glad there was an epilogue.",

The victim of a famous kidnapping as a child and a widow four times over, Ruby ruled the tiny town of Tavistock from Ashby House, her family’s estate high in the Blue Ridge mountains. In the aftermath of her death, that estate—along with a nine-figure fortune and the complicated legacy of being a McTavish—pass to her adopted son, Camden. But to everyone’s surprise, Cam wants little to do with the house or the money—and even less to do with the surviving McTavishes. Instead, he rejects his inheritance, settling into a normal life as an English teacher in Colorado and marrying Jules, a woman just as eager to escape her own messy past. Ten years later, Camden is a McTavish in name only, but a summons in the wake of his uncle’s death brings him and Jules back into the family fold at Ashby House. Its views are just as stunning as ever, its rooms just as elegant, but coming home reminds Cam why he was so quick to leave in the first place. Jules, however, has other ideas, and the more she learns about Cam’s estranged family—and the twisted secrets they keep—the more determined she is for her husband to claim everything Ruby once intended for him to have. But Ruby’s plans were always more complicated than they appeared. As Ashby House tightens its grip on Jules and Camden, questions about the infamous heiress come to light. Was there any truth to the persistent rumors following her disappearance as a girl? What really happened to those four husbands, who all died under mysterious circumstances? And why did she adopt Cam in the first place? Soon, Jules and Cam realize that an inheritance can entail far more than what’s written in a will—and that the bonds of family stretch far beyond the grave.",

She was the sole owner of the McTavish's fortune. She was also abducted when she was a child and returned home to Ashby House after a year of being taken. Ruby never got along with her sister Nelle who seemed to be full of envy and jealousy towards her. Ruby was also married four times and all her husbands died. Did she kill them or did she just have bad luck in love? The second one is from Camden. Ruby's adopted son. He was bullied while growing up by his cousin Ben and hated by Nelle. As soon as Ruby passed, Camden left for California. Leaving his inheritance behind and working as a teacher he is much happier especially when he meets his future wife, Jules. Then, he is summoned to come back to Ashby House after the passing of his step-uncle. The third comes from Jules, Camden's wife. She can't wait to move into Ashby House. She feels they deserve the estate and they need to get rid of the people who made Camden's life hell. Yet, things are never that clear once they get there. The Heiress is an atmospheric and full-of-intrigue novel with perfect-timing twists that had me turning the pages as fast as I could. A winner for sure!",

When a Category 5 hurricane is poised to hit their coastal Florida town, the Davies family takes refuge in their waterfront manse. Marlowe, Lee, and their teenage twins invite their close friends to wait out the storm in comfort and style. Uninvited are the three strangers who dock on the family’s shore right before the storm descends. Brothers Jason and Bo—and Bo’s girlfriend, Darcy—are a charming, helpful trio in need of a safe haven that the Davies are only too happy to provide. But as the storm outside grows more threatening, so does the tension in the house. Soon, the lines between family, friends, and strangers blur.

After all, the house was built with hurricane standards. Even if this is the wrong decision, it is too late to leave the premises. Traffic is at a standstill with all the people who are trying to evacuate. If they leave now, they will just be experiencing the hurricane winds on the road. Staying at their home should be safer or so they think until a boat carrying three strangers arrives uninvited at their dock. Two brothers (Bo and Jason) and Bo's girlfriend Darcy join the Davies and their friends who are already in the house. As the storm rages, the possibility that the brothers showed up as a coincidence becomes doubtful and a more menacing plan seems to be in the works. The Guests had a good amount of suspense and I felt bad for Marlowe and her kids. I was rooting for them to succeed in surviving the night. I had some issues with the storyline and how naive some of the characters were. The end was too far-fetched for my taste which took some of the enjoyment away from the novel.",

    sinopsis: "Evie Porter has everything a nice, Southern girl could want: a perfect, doting boyfriend, a house with a white picket fence and a garden, a fancy group of friends. The only catch: Evie Porter doesn’t exist. The identity comes to Evie Porter. Once she’s given a name and location by her mysterious boss Mr. Smith, she learns everything there is to know about the town and the people in it. Then the target: Ryan Sumner. The last piece of the puzzle is the job. Evie isn’t privy to Mr. Smith’s real identity, but she knows this job will be different. Ryan has gotten under her skin, and she’s starting to envision a different sort of life for herself. But Evie can’t make any mistakes--especially after what happened last time. Because the one thing she’s worked her entire life to keep clean, the one identity she could always go back to—her real identity—just walked right into this town. Evie Porter must stay one step ahead of her past while making sure there’s still a future in front of her. The stakes couldn't be higher--but then, Evie has always liked a challenge...",

    review: "Perfectly crafted thriller! Evie Porter is living the suburban life with her boyfriend, Ryan Sumner. She wishes for a garden and to have a place to call home. She can envision this future with Ryan. The only problem is that she is not really Evie Porter. Ryan is the next mark on Mr Smith's list. 'Evie' has worked for Mr. Smith for the last few years and her identity is created and changed depending on what he wants from his targets. Evie is the best at what she does but Ryan has made her question her future. A truly enjoyable thriller from the very first chapter. Ashley Elston has written a fast-paced, twisty-galore, and addictive story that kept me glued to the pages.",

    sinopsis: "After a year in captivity, a kidnapped child escapes―only to reveal horrific truths that lead her psychologist on a race against time in this thriller from New York Times bestselling author Mike Omer. When eight-year-old Kathy Stone turns up on the side of the road a year after her abduction, the world awaits her harrowing story. But Kathy doesn’t say a word. Traumatized by her ordeal, she doesn’t speak at all, not even to her own parents. Child therapist Robin Hart is the only one who’s had success connecting with the girl. Robin has been using play therapy to help Kathy process her memories. But as their work continues, Kathy’s playtime takes a grim turn: a doll looks to stab another doll, a tiny figurine is chained to a plastic toy couch. All of these horrifying moments, enacted within a Victorian doll house. Every session, another toy dies. But the most disturbing detail? Kathy seems to be playacting real unsolved murders. Soon Robin wonders if Kathy not only holds the key to the murders of the past but if she knows something about the murders of the future. Can Robin unlock the secrets in Kathy’s brain and stop a serial killer before he strikes again? Or is Robin’s work with Kathy putting her in the killer’s sights?",
    imageR: mrsleifReview,
    review: "This had a disappointing ending. The novel begins with a child, Kathy Stone, escaping capture. She had disappeared for a year when she was found wandering around the road at night. Her parents are ecstatic to get her back but Kathy has been non-verbal since returning. Her mother knows she must get help and she believes the local child therapist, Robin Hart, can help her. Robin followed the case of Kathy's shocking disappearance like the rest of the town. When Kathy's mother asks her to help her daughter, Robin can't say no and takes the case. Robin wants to help Kathy and her play sessions are usually quite successful. As Kathy starts trusting Robin, the therapy process, and her own safety,  her reenactments become too real. It seems that Kathy is reenacting real murders!! I have a few issues with the story and the characters. Robin is supposed to be a great therapist but her relationship with her own mother is so dysfunctional and the whole thing with the dollhouse was nuts. Her behavior was beyond childish. You would think she would have learned some coping mechanisms to deal with her crazy mother. The worst was where the story went at the end. In my opinion, the big reveal was too out there to be believable.",

When Iris decides to move to New York to restart her life, she realizes she underestimated how big the Big Apple really is—all the nostalgic movies set in New York she’d watched with her mom while eating their special secret-recipe gelato didn’t quite do it justice. But Bobby, Iris’s best friend, isn’t about to let her hide away. He drags her to a famous autumn street fair in Little Italy, and as they walk through the food stalls, a little family-run gelateria catches her eye—could it be the same shop that’s in an old photo of her mother’s? Curious, Iris returns the next day and meets the handsome Gio, who tells her that the shop is in danger of closing. His uncle, sole keeper of their family’s gelato recipe, is in a coma, so they can’t make more. When Iris samples the last remaining batch, she realizes that their gelato and her gelato are one and the same. But how can she tell them she knows their secret recipe when she’s not sure why Gio’s uncle gave it to her mother in the first place? Iris offers her services as a chef to help them re-create the flavor and finds herself falling for Gio and his family. But when Gio’s uncle finally wakes up, all of the secrets Iris has been keeping threaten to ruin the new life—and new love—she’s been building all winter long.",

Then she moved to New York City after leaving London or escaping London should be a better way to describe it. She was in an abusive relationship and she finally was able to leave him behind. Iris is a chef but in NYC, she is working in a noodle restaurant. Here is where she met Bobby, her friend who offered her a job and a place to stay. Iris doesn't go out much but when Bobby insists that she must go with him to the Little Italy's autumn fair, she can't say no. Her future changes when she stumbles into a family-owned gelateria with a door that seems familiar to her. She remembers the door from a picture her mother had. Her curiosity makes her return to it and walking inside she meets Gio, one of the family owners. Gio is in dire straights. His gelateria might close soon. Santo his uncle and father figure had a stroke. Santo is the one who has the secret recipe for the famous vanilla gelato they have been serving for years. Unbeknownst to Gio, Iris knows the recipe and she has been making it for years. Her mother had been given the recipe years earlier by someone in Gio's family! How can Iris help Gio without revealing secrets that could hurt him? I liked the story. Gio was sweet and caring. His family was amazing. They all treated Iris so well. I also loved Bobby. He was there for Iris when she needed a helping hand. I had some issues with Iris. I didn't like how many secrets she had and the lies she was keeping. Overall, it was an enjoyable story.",

Once an adult though, the fae ask a favor of Toadling: return to the human world and offer a blessing of protection to a newborn child. Simple, right? But nothing with fairies is ever simple.

Furthermore, she is told that she must go back to the human world and give a blessing to a child. Due to her inexperience, the blessing she performs turns into a curse. As the years pass and the danger grows, Toadling decides to do what must be done to stop worse things from happening. Centuries later, Toadling's isolation is interrupted when a knight stops by trying to break the curse. Toadling thinks he would be better off staying away but she can't seem to make him leave and starts looking forward to spending time with him. But can she let him break the curse? I like the writing, the descriptions, and the main character, Toadling. Yet, I did feel like the end was underwhelming.",

But behind the holly and pine boughs, secrets are about to unravel, revealing this seemingly charming English village's grim history. Ashley Smith, an American art student in London for her junior year, was planning on spending Christmas alone, but a last-minute invitation from fellow student Emma Chapman brings her to Starvewood Hall, country residence of the Chapman family. The Cotswold manor house, festooned in pine boughs and crammed with guests for Christmas week, is a dream come true for Ashley. She is mesmerized by the cozy, firelit house, the large family, and the charming village of Clevemoor, but also by Adam Chapman, Emma's aloof and handsome brother. But Adam is being investigated by the local police over the recent brutal slaying of a girl from the village, and there is a mysterious stranger who haunts the woodland path between Starvewood Hall and the local pub. Ashley begins to wonder what kind of story she is actually inhabiting. Is she in a grand romance? A gothic tale? Or has she wandered into something far more sinister and terrifying than she'd ever imagined? Over thirty years later the events of that horrific week are revisited, along with a diary from that time. What began in a small English village in 1989 reaches its ghostly conclusion in modern-day New York, many Christmas seasons later.",

Ashley is more excited about the trip after meeting Ashley's twin brother, Adam. The days spent in Starwood Hall are full of family, games, food, and the local bars.  Ashley finds herself falling for Adam. He is charismatic and spending time in his company is exciting to Ashley until she discovers that Adam is the prime suspect in the murder of a local woman who looks like her. In the blink of an eye, this goes from being a romance to becoming a horror novel.

    sinopsis: "Virgil Flowers has always been known for having a somewhat active, er, social life, but he's probably not going to be getting too many opportunities during his new case. While competing in a fishing tournament in northern Minnesota, he gets a call from Lucas Davenport to investigate a murder at a nearby resort where a woman has been shot while kayaking. The resort is for women only, a place to relax, get fit, recover from plastic surgery, commune with nature, and while it didn't start out to be a place mostly for those with Sapphic inclinations, that's pretty much what it is today. Which makes things more complicated for Virgil because, as he begins investigating, he finds connections between people at the resort and some local women, notably a talented country singer. The more he digs, the more he discovers arrows of suspicion that point in many directions, with many motives: jealousy, blackmail, greed, anger, and fear. Then he discovers that this is not the first murder, that there was a second, seemingly unrelated, the year before. And that there's about to be a third, definitely related. As to a fourth... well, Virgil better hope he can catch the killer before that happens. Because it could be his own. Librarian's note: as of 2021, there are 13 volumes in the author's Virgil Flowers series. The last was published in April 2021. It is part of the 'Prey' series but Lucas Davenport and Virgil Flowers share the billing - 'Ocean Prey.'",

    review: "Ok, now I'm starting to really like this series. As a fan of the Lucas Davenport series, it was hard not to compare the two series. The end result was Virgil's falling short every time. It pays to trust the author. In the first two books, I was missing the funny one-liners and the banter Lucas has with everyone. In Rough Country, we finally get Virgil showing some of the same. Now to the story: The novel begins with Virgil on vacation. He is participating in a fishing tournament when Lucas calls and assigns him a new job. A woman has been killed while canoeing. As soon as he gets there, many become suspects. It's up to Virgil to figure out who is behind the murder. I can't wait to start the next one.",

    review: "I got to say it, this was fantastic! I know some readers didn't like the ending and I kind of agree with it but I loved the book so much and would love to see it as a movie. Three women's destinies can be cut short unless they can survive what is coming for them. The first woman we are introduced to is Celia. She wakes up one morning in a house she doesn't recognize, with a daughter she doesn't remember giving birth to and a husband with whom she doesn't feel any connection at all. The only thing that seems to bring a spark of recognition, is the restaurant she is working at. Cooking relaxes her and she knows how to do it. Her life makes no sense to her and she is pretty sure that this is NOT her life. Why can't she remember her past? The second woman is Allie. She is in her twenties. She is supposed to spend her birthday at the beach with her two best friends. However, the two friends's boyfriends have decided to show up too. Worse while the girls were sleeping instead of going to the beach, they woke up in a remote cabin. Why are they there? And who is out there stalking them? Third but not least is Maggie. She is abducted from her home. She finds herself in a container with other women who have been abducted as well. Men come in and the women are told that they need to enter a maze and survive it if they want to live and see their loved ones again. Maggie can only think about her child. She must survive at all costs. You can feel the tension while reading Good Girls Don't Die. The sense that time was running out and their lives were at stake. I liked all three women. They were survivors and despite their horrible circumstances, they were going to fight until the end for their freedom.",

He was soon to set his crown aside; he had married the woman he loved; he was going to be a father. After centuries of searching for a family of his own, he had finally found a way to construct the life of his dreams, and was looking forward to a period of peace—or at least as much peace as is ever in the offing for the husband of a hero. Alas for Tybalt and his domestic aspirations, fate—and Titania—had other ideas. His perfect world had been complete for only a moment when it was ripped away, to be replaced by hers. Titania, Faerie’s Summer Queen, Mother of Illusions and enemy of so many he holds dear, has seized control of the Kingdom, remaking it in her own image. An image which does not include meddlesome shapeshifters getting in her way. Tybalt quickly finds himself banished from her reality, along with the Undersea and the rest of the Court of Cats. To protect his people and his future, Tybalt must find the woman he loves in a world designed to keep her from him, convince her that he’s not a stranger trying to ruin her life for no apparent reason, and get her to unmake the illusion she’s been firmly enmeshed in.

I'm not going to lie, it was painful seeing Tybalt suffering not knowing what had happened to Toby, and then when he found out where she was and what happened to her,  he realized that nothing could be done for several months. Tybalt embarks on a journey of his own. He needs to find enough allies who will be ready to help and fight for what is right and real.

She could really do without the drama. Particularly as he’s engaged again, and she’s just been dumped for the fourth time this year. Christian’s fed up of being on his own every Christmas. He doesn’t mind being alone, but he hates his family’s sad eyes and soft tones as they sit around coupled up. Because he’s actually, totally, fine. So when Megan literally bumps into Christian in a Dublin pub, they come up with a pact to see them through the holiday season. They’re going to be the very best fake dates for each other, ever. Rules are drawn up, a contract is signed on a wine-stained napkin. They will sit through each other’s family gatherings and be outrageously in love until freed from their annual obligations. After all, it’s only for a few weeks. But with everyone home for the holidays, two big families to deal with alongside old friends, old flames and old feelings, things are bound to get messy. And when a snowed-in cabin and a little Christmas magic are added to the mix, anything could happen… A swoonworthy and utterly gorgeous romantic comedy that will make you laugh out loud and fall completely in love.

She was going to marry her high school sweetheart, Isaac. Yet, Isaac was not really sweet but she never told anyone. Christian knows his family expects him to return home for the holidays but he is not looking forward to it. His family is all coupled up except for him. So when he bumps into Megan at a Dublin bar, he realizes they have something in common, neither can return home without a significant other. The best plan would be to make their family believe that they are a couple and that way they can enjoy the holidays without the pressure. It was so nice going back to the town and these characters. Megan and Christian were easy to like and root for. I can't wait for the next one in this series.",

I do like his winning formula of inserting himself and his life into the world where a serial killer is out to get him. Chizmar gave us enough questions, including if there was a new killer and if he was someone he already knew. Was he just following orders from someone from prison? or if a copycat was lurking on his property just to create non-stop fear. The ending gives a perfect place for book 3 which I would read without hesitation.",

Liam Carlisle is working as a stripper while he finishes med school. When he meets Marissa, he can't avoid proposing a private show. Fun and interesting characters in this short novella. I like that Liam wasn't embarrassed about his side job. He was pretty confident. They made a good couple.",

But he's secretly loved her since the first time he saw her in second grade, even if she never loved him back. When the opportunity arises to help her out, he can't resist.

The press and the police called Charlie a 'witness' to the nightmarish events at her elite graduate school on Christmas Eve—events known to the public as 'Scarlet Christmas'—though Charlie knows she was much more than that. Now, Charlie has meticulously rebuilt her life: She's the editor-in-chief of a major magazine, engaged to the golden child of the publishing industry, and hell-bent on never, ever letting her guard down again. But when a buzzy film made by one of Charlie's former classmates threatens to shatter everything she's worked for, Charlie realizes how much she's changed in nine years.

    review: "With the incredibly engaging book name, I was excited to read this novel. Yet, I can't say that I loved it. Charlie Colbert is the current editor-in-chief of a prestigious magazine called C. She is engaged to be married to Tripp who is a rich heir in the publishing world. Charlie reinvented herself after a horrible tragedy that occurred nine years earlier. During her time as a student at Carroll, three people died in what is known as the Scarlett Christmas. A book has been published about the events of that night and now a movie is in the works. Charlie is not able to handle it. She needs to stop the movie from coming out. She is not sure what happened because at some point she passed out. She does worry if she hurt someone that night. With the help of her therapist, Charlie will try to piece together what happened that horrible day before the movie is out. I liked the first half of the book. I was interested in learning what really happened that night and who were the people who died. Unfortunately, the last part of the novel didn't work for me. It felt rushed and sloppy. Also, the romance between Tripp and Charlie felt lacking. Why were they even together? This was a buddy read with Jayme and DeAnn. Check out their reviews.",

Celebrating her forty-fifth birthday at her local pub, popular podcaster Alix Summers crosses paths with an unassuming woman called Josie Fair. Josie, it turns out, is also celebrating her forty-fifth birthday. They are, in fact, birthday twins. A few days later, Alix and Josie bump into each other again, this time outside Alix’s children’s school. Josie has been listening to Alix’s podcasts and thinks she might be an interesting subject for her series. She is, she tells Alix, on the cusp of great changes in her life. Josie’s life appears to be strange and complicated, and although Alix finds her unsettling, she can’t quite resist the temptation to keep making the podcast. Slowly she starts to realise that Josie has been hiding some very dark secrets, and before she knows it, Josie has inveigled her way into Alix’s life—and into her home. But, as quickly as she arrived, Josie disappears. Only then does Alix discover that Josie has left a terrible and terrifying legacy in her wake, and that Alix has become the subject of her own true crime podcast, with her life and her family’s lives under mortal threat. Who is Josie Fair? And what has she done?",

On a closeby table, Josie Fair is also celebrating her birthday. She is also turning forty. When Alix goes to the restroom, Josie follows. They have a brief interaction where Josie tells Alix, they are birth twins. The next time they see each other, Josie is outside her children's school. Josie convinces Alix that she will be a great next subject for Alix's new podcast. Josie tells her, she is on the brink of major changes in her life and that she is ready to tell her story. The more Josie reveals, the more shocked Alix is. On the one hand, Alix wants to stop because Josie has a dark energy but on the other hand, she knows she has gold in her hands. The podcast will be a sure success. Then Josie and her husband both disappear. What has Josie done? I did enjoy this book until the last part. I felt too many things were left open-ended. What was true? What was a lie? Who killed who? I am okay with leaving things for the reader to interpret but here there were way too many unanswered questions. Would I read another book by Lisa Jewell? Of course, I would.",

As his freedom approaches, Bailey gets a surprise visit from Maddison Logan, a hot, young influencer with a huge social media following. Hours later, Maddison disappears, and police suspect she’s been kidnapped—or worse. Is Maddison’s disappearance connected to her visit to Bailey? Why was she visiting him in the first place? When they hit a wall in the investigation, the FBI reluctantly asks for Rachel’s help in finding the missing influencer. Maddison seems only to exist on social media; she has no family, no friends, and other than in her posts, most people have never seen her. Who is she, really? Using a fake Instagram account, Rachel Krall goes undercover to BuzzCon, a popular influencer conference, where she discovers a world of fierce rivalry that may have turned lethal. When police find the body of a woman with a tattoo of a snake eating its tail, the FBI must consider a chilling possibility: Bailey has an accomplice on the outside and a dangerous obsession with influencers, including Rachel Krell herself. Suddenly a target of a monster hiding in plain sight, Rachel is forced to confront the very real dangers that lurk in the dark corners of the internet. Rachel Krall, the true crime podcaster star of Megan Goldin’s acclaimed Night Swim returns to search for a popular social media influencer who disappeared after visiting a suspected serial killer.",

    review: "I enjoyed Night Swim and Rachell Krall's character. I was glad Megan Goldin decided to bring her back. Rachel is an athlete but she is better known as a true crime podcaster. Rachel is called by the FBI to come to Florida. A prisoner, Terence Bailey has shown a desire to speak with her after being visited by a famous influencer, Maddison Logan. Terence is in prison for breaking and entering but he is suspected of the murder of six sex workers. In forty-eight hours his release is imminent and the FBI will ask for any help trying to keep him locked up for life. Rachel is intrigued about why he is asking for her and even more so when she learns that Maddison has gone missing too. A video shows someone possibly abducting her. Does this mean that Terence had an accomplice? Rachel decides to infiltrate BuzzCon, an influencer meeting. She will go undercover using her athlete's account instead of her true crime persona. The more Rachel learns about Maddison and the other influencers the more questions she has. Has someone kidnapped her or has she created this to increase her followers count? What is the connection with Terence? and is there a second killer? I enjoyed this one but not as much as the Night Swim. I like Rachel although, at times, I thought she put herself in danger despite the FBI agent telling her to pack her things and go before the serial killer got close to her.",

What she doesn’t know is why Nolan has broken their rules by not telling her about the job in advance. The more Ren looks into the attack, the more she begins to question: Who really hired Nolan?

Tara was an art teacher but she won't be able to return to her job. She will need to start her life all over again. Without a place to call her own and without money, she will need to stay at their childhood home with her other 2 siblings and her nephew.

Eddie Connelly: He had a traumatic brain injury many years ago but he's still dealing with the sequela of his trauma. He gets debilitating headaches. Eddie has a son, Connor who lives with him after his mother left them. Geraldine Connelly: She likes rules and tries to keep the house running. She feels responsible for her family. She is also very stressed at work and in reality, being overwhelmed is a better way to describe her. I love the dynamics of the main characters brought to life by Tracey Lange. Despite being flawed characters, it was hard not to root for a good outcome for all of them. The Connellys had not been treated well by life and you wanted a win for them.",

Since narrowly escaping death at the hands of the man who kidnapped her, she’s thrown herself into the small inn she runs in Rock Harbor, Maine. It’s quiet, quaint and, in the off-season, completely isolated—the perfect place for Grace to keep her own secrets. But Grace isn’t the only one with something to hide, and Rock Harbor isn’t just a sleepy vacation town. Someone is taking young women—girls who look an awful lot like Grace did when she was kidnapped so many years ago. When a surge of disappearances brings the investigation to her door, Grace finds herself unwillingly at the center of it all and doing everything she can to keep her distance. Because Grace knows something…something that could change everything. And when the truth comes to light, getting justice for the vanished might be more than Grace can handle alone…",

Over the years, drug addicts and prostitutes have disappeared from this sketchy area of town in Rock Harbor, Maine. The latest young woman who was taken is Brooke Everett. Her mother Kira Everett will do anything to find her daughter. She follows all the clues she can get her hands on. She knows the police might not be enough. Besides Brooke, Aden Coleman's father has also disappeared. At first, Aden thinks that he might have gone fishing and will be back soon but after talking to the police, he is not sure about this anymore. He decides to stay in an inn until his father is found. Grace Holloway works for the local Inn. Usually, during summer it's busy but during winter, she has the place to herself. You see eight years ago, Grace was abducted and kept for a month until she was able to escape. Since then, she has kept to herself and doesn't watch TV or have a social media presence. However, she can't continue to stay in her cocoon when she discovers women who look like her are the ones being taken. The Vanishing Hour started strong but the last third was chaos.

The story is told from several points of view, including The Husband, one of the detectives investigating the case,  the Mom (murdered woman), the Kid (child of the deceased woman), Nora (The Leading Lady), the Accomplice, and the Leading Man. I remember when this book came out some of my book friends didn't love it. Maybe because I went in with low expectations, I found myself enjoying this book so much.  I couldn't put it away! In regards to the characters, I liked the Detective the most. I wish I could see her in another story, I really like her.

Sam is trying to become a partner at the firm he works at. Due to the financial drain the new house has become their relationship is strained. Sam belittles her and keeps on reminding her that when she changed her job, she made a mistake (getting paid less money, and no good promotions in her future).

Alexis worries about the murder. Who did it? Is one of the neighbors responsible for it? Alexis feels bad for Blair, the widow, and can't stay away and offers support. Soon a friendship develops until Alexis finds herself trying to piece together a deadly secret Blair might have. A slow burn with some good twists, although I guessed the important ones.

    review: "This is the second book in this series. I love the Lucas Davenport's books (John Sandford's other series) and I like Virgil Flowers who had cameos in multiple of those books. Virgil Flowers is part of the BCA and his new cases are assigned to him by his boss Lucas. Heat Lightning finds Virgil following the murders of men who are left at veterans' memorials or monuments. The victims all have a lemon in their mouths. Virgil finds clues pointing to these murders linked with the Vietnam War. He is sure more targets are coming unless he can find who they are otherwise he is running out of time. I like Virgil. Physically, he looks like a surfer. He has a laid-back attitude. He likes to go out on his boat and fish. He likes to dance. He is a writer with a good future. He has been married and divorced three times.  Virgil likes the ladies although he seems to fall in love with all of them.  However, his best quality is that he is a thinker and that's the way he catches his prey.  ",

    sinopsis: "Destiny, duty, and desire clash in this epic new novel in J.R. Ward’s #1 New York Times bestselling Black Dagger Brotherhood series. Lassiter, the fallen angel, is too good at the savior business. In his new role overseeing the fates of all vampires, he’s influenced outcomes he shouldn’t have—so the Creator is calling him home. But the angel has a reason to stay in Caldwell. He’s bonded with a mysterious female who seemed to appear from out of nowhere...and has powers that defy all reason. Rahvyn is well aware that she doesn’t belong in the present. And she never intended to stay, for her true place is in the past. Lassiter proves to be undeniable, however, and she lets herself fall for the angel—until a secret he’s been keeping comes out and she fears that for him, it’s not about love, but duty. As the Omega’s son reestablishes the Lessening Society, and the Brotherhood must resume the deadly war, an unfathomable tragedy occurs. In the aftermath, Rahvyn has to decide whether to stay and help—or save herself from an immortal heartbreak she knows will crush her very soul... ",

    review: "In my opinion, this book can't be read as a standalone. I was looking forward to finally reading Lassiter's book and loving it but it turns out it was not as fantastic as I hoped. A few books ago, Lassiter took over the Scribe Virgin's job. He has been there interfering in the right way to help the good guys get their happy endings. When it was finally his turn, I thought the lady he fell for would be fantastic.  Yet, I found myself not crazy for Rahvyne's character. She has so many special powers but I don't think she used them as much as she should or at the right time she could. An incredible loss of opportunity.  Furthermore, Lassiter didn't act like himself. He was not the jokester he usually is. He was more serious than ever. The other thing that bothered me was the way Devina and Lash behaved. She could be formidable but spent most of her time trying to get Lash's attention and love while he was trying to escape her when he could. The last thing that made me upset was what J.R. Ward did to a beloved couple. You don't do that. They already had a difficult time during their own HEA trajectory so no reason to make them suffer again. Will I continue reading this series? Of course I will, I need to know what happens next.",

    review: "It sucked me in! It's time for Murderpalooza! The main thriller conference is for fans to get closer to their idols and for writers to network into their next book deal. The last evening of the conference, it finishes with an award ceremony. Then, on the first morning of the event, one of the nominees to win the award, Kristin Bailey is found murdered in her hotel room. Kristin was quite famous and successful. She was liked well by other writers. Who would want to hurt her? Suddenly, a new Twitter account pops up and goes by the handle @MpaloozaNxt2Die. This account is only following four writers, all with connections to Kristin: Vicky Overton is another nominee. She lives in Florida (yay) with her boyfriend Jim. She is hoping to get her agent/publisher to promote her second book. Davis Walton is the most famous author despite his novel not being published yet. He already has a movie deal and women are sweet on him. Mike Brooks is the Has Been. He had a super successful first few years but now his books are not selling. He is working on promoting his newest novel which he co-wrote with a mystery author. The last one in this quartet is Suzanne Shih. She has signed with an agent for her first novel. She is super excited about the whole event as a fan and a newbie writer. She is also Kristin's stalker. Did one of them do it or is one of them the next one to die? My favorite characters were Vicky and Mike. Davis was hateful for the most part and Suzanne needed to be committed. I was able to guess the main twist but there was a couple that I didn't see coming I truly enjoyed, Jaime Lynn Hendricks's Finding Tessa, didn't read her sophomore book but I'm glad I read I Didn't Do It. I can't wait for what she has planned next.",

'A raw and genuine look at motherhood, A Little Ray of Sunshine is a lovely ode to love in all of its many forms, family lost and found' Ashley Poston, author of The Dead Romantics. A kid walks into your bookstore and... guess what? He's your son. The one you put up for adoption eighteen years ago. The one you never told anyone about. Surprise! And a huge surprise it is. It's a huge surprise to his adoptive mother, Monica, who thought she had a close relationship with Matthew, her nearly adult son. Until he secretly arranged a vacation to Cape Cod so he could meet his birth mother... without a word to her. It's also a surprise to Harlow, the woman who secretly placed him for adoption so many years ago. She has built a quiet life, running a bookstore with her grandfather, and is happily single... though she can't help gravitating toward Grady Byrne, an old friend who has moved back to town, three-year-old daughter in tow, and no wife in the picture. When Matthew walks into Harlow's store, she faints. Monica panics. And all their assumptions about what being a parent really means explode... This summer will be full of more surprises as both their families are redefined...and as both women learn that for them, there's no limit to a mother's love.",

    review: "As a huge Kristan Higgins fan, I knew I had to read A Little Ray of Sunshine. This novel deals with adoption and all the feelings surrounding it from the mom who gives her child to strangers, to the parents who get the new baby, to the child wanting to know more about his birth parents. Harlow lives in Cape Cod with her family. She is a part owner of a bookstore in conjunction with her grandfather and her distant cousin, Cynthia. Harlow receives the shock of her life when the child she gave away when she was seventeen walks into her bookstore. Of course, she was not ready and proceeded to faint. When she comes back, she realizes her son Matthew is truly there with his adoptive father. Harlow couldn't be happier that Matthew came looking for her but how is she going to explain it to her family who have no clue she did this in college. The only person who knows of her devastation and sorrow was her roommate at that time. Monica Patel works hard to make sure her family has what they need. She is always providing for them and her children's future. Since the moment she got Matthew in her arms, Monica has dedicated herself to being the best mom she could be. As part of the summer, the Patels have always taken a vacation together, and this year the place her son picked was Cape Cod. When she finds out that he did it because of Harlow, she can't believe how sneaky he has become. She is so mad that he blindsided them and Harlow. Cynthia Millstone is part owner of the bookstore too. Her personality is off-putting. She believes she is above others and more refined than the Smiths but her marriage fails and without any money, the only choice she had was to move to Cap Cod. The only person from that family she likes is Grandpop. There are pretty interesting and well-developed characters in this book. I do have favorites. I love Grandpop, Oliver Twist (the dog), and Grady Byrne. I was able to see both sides of the coin in regard to Harlow and Monica. Felt super bad for Monica and all the sacrifices she had to make to give her family what they needed. I'm not going to lie, I do miss some of Kristan's earlier books when the romance was forefront but I will read anything she writes.",

Possessed by the demon Devina, Balthazar is once again on the hunt for the Book of Spells—and fighting an undeniable attraction to a woman. As a thief, he has stolen a lot of things…but he never thought his heart would be taken by another. Especially not a human. As a homicide detective, Erika Saunders knows there is something otherworldly going on in Caldwell, New York. Mutilated bodies that cannot be explained are all over her case list—and then there are her nightmares in which she’s hunted by shadows and captivated by a mysterious man who is both a suspect and a savior. When Devina’s wish for true love is finally granted, Balthazar and Erika unwittingly become the gateway for the rebirth of an old enemy of the Brothers. Will the very thing that brings them together lead to the ultimate destruction of the Brotherhood? Or will they have to lose everything in order to save the race’s most sacred defenders?",

    review: "This time is Balthazar and Erika's story. Balthazar is part of the Band of Bastards. He is also a thief and a great one as well. Think of him more like Robin Hood. Stealing from the wealthy and giving to the poor. He won't apologize for it. Erika Saunders is the cop we have met in prior books. She suffered a tragedy as a teenager and because of it, she became a cop to try to help people or maybe to atone for her guilt. When these two meet, the sparks are heavy in the ambiance. There is just a little problem, Balthazar has been possessed by the demon, Devina. Lover Arisen also sets the chain of events for the next book in this series since we get some Nate, Rayven, and Lassiter. I don't get tired of reading these books. Even though, they all have the same format in regards to Hero and Heroine that fall in love and fight adversity to end up with their Happily Ever After. I did like both characters. Erika was self-sufficient and she was not scared of fighting Devina with whatever she had. Balthazar has always been a favorite since he was introduced into the series. I wish he had more talks with the other Bastards since they are his true brothers. I don't like that an old baddie has made a comeback but we shall see what happens because of it. The next one should be interesting for sure.",

Amy Daniels has a pretty nice life. Her career is on the up, she loves her friends, and she's about to buy her very own flat. On a good day, Amy could be described as a catch—so why is she perpetually single? The trouble is, Amy can see something no one else the end. As soon as she kisses someone, she knows, in intimate, vivid detail, how their relationship will finish. A screaming argument in the middle of the supermarket over milk.

But then she drunkenly kisses three men at her best friend's wedding and sees three possible two painful, one perfect.

So you can see, how this would make her fearful of failure. Then, during her friend Charlotte's wedding, she drinks a little too much and she kisses three men. The next day, she knows one of the three was her happy ending. The problem is that she can't recall who was the right guy for her and who wasn't. Amy will embark on a quest to find the right guy with the few clues she has. I knew her HEA from the very beginning but I was not going to tell Amy. She needed to go through the motions of realizing who was the right guy for her. I thought this was a great premise with wonderful characters and situations.",

Born to be the changeling handmaid to her beloved sister August, she spends her days working in her family’s tower, serving as August’s companion, and waiting for the day when her sister sets up a household of her own. Everything is right in October’s Faerie. Everything is perfect. Everything is a lie. October has been pulled from her own reality and thrown into a twisted reinterpretation of Faerie where nothing is as it should be and everything has been distorted to support Titania’s ideals. Bound by the Summer Queen’s magic and thrust into a world turned upside down, October has no way of knowing who she can trust, where she can turn, or even who she really is. As strangers who claim to know her begin to appear and the edges of Titania’s paradise begin to unravel, Toby will have to decide whether she can risk everything she knows based on only their stories of another world. But first she’ll have to survive this one, as Titania demonstrates why she needed to be banished in the first place—and this time, much more than Toby’s own life is at stake.",

    review: "Gosh, how did I miss a new Toby book? My only excuse will be (once again) my work. I strongly recommend reading these books in order to experience the world Seanan McGuire has created. Toby is like a dear old friend who runs into trouble but has learned to have others with her when the battle is about to happen. The last book was a shock for all of us.  It also ended in a HUGE cliffhanger. So please don’t read below if you don’t want to get spoiled about the last book. --- In this new world that Titania has created, Toby is no one. She has been placed in Faerie with the sole purpose of caring for her sister August. Her father Simon treats her well and her mother, Amandine is still not a good mother. Toby who is a changeling is delegated as the 'help'. She is not a fighter. She follows the rules she is given.  She is meek and living in a tower without any real interaction with the courts. She is no hero. Then the weirdest thing happens, Toby is told that her current reality is nothing but a lie created by Titania. The more blood Toby is in contact with, the more flashes she sees of another life that she doesn't know but maybe she should be part of. I’m not going to lie, it was extremely hard to see Toby so weak. This Toby wouldn’t dream of talking back to any pureblood or of breaking the mold, fighting for a different life for all changelings. The only thing that made it bearable was seeing how little by little we got glimpses of the real Toby and by the end, you knew she was going to do what she does best: Create some chaos and defeat the current threat. If I could change something from Sleep No More it would be the amount of pages Tybalt has. He deserves so much more. A true King of Cats.",

    sinopsis: "New York Times bestselling author Tracey Garvis Graves takes readers on a life affirming journey, where two lost souls find the unexpected courage to love again. Thirty-four-year-old Wren Waters believes that if you pay attention, the universe will send you exactly what you need. But her worldview shatters when the universe delivers two life-altering blows she didn’t see coming, and all she wants to do is put the whole heartbreaking mess behind her. No one is more surprised than Wren when she discovers that geocaching―the outdoor activity of using GPS to look for hidden objects―is the only thing getting her out of bed and out of her head. She decides that a weeklong solo quest geocaching in Oregon is exactly what she needs to take back control of her life. Enter Marshall Hendricks, a psychologist searching for distraction as he struggles with a life-altering blow of his own. Though Wren initially rebuffs Marshall’s attempt at hiker small talk, she’s beyond grateful when he rescues her from a horrifying encounter farther down the trail. In the interest of safety, Marshall suggests partnering up to look for additional caches. Wren’s no longer quite so trusting of the universe―or men in general―but her inner circle might argue that a smart, charismatic psychologist isn’t the worst thing the universe could place in her path. What begins as a platonic road trip gradually blossoms into something deeper, and the more Wren learns about Marshall, the more she wants to know. Now all she can do is hope that the universe gets it right this time.",

She is down and depressed until she finds out about Geocaching. This outdoor activity is the only thing getting her out of her bed and her thoughts. Wren decides to embark on geocaching on a hike trail in Oregon away from her friends and everyone who knows her. Marshall Hendricks is a psychologist. He meets Wren on the trail, realizes she is after a cache, and offers to find it together. After Wren turns him down, they meet again when he helps her out of a dangerous situation. He proposes to continue their geocaching journey together; this time, Wren is in. What starts as strangers develops into friendship and then into something more but are they both ready to move on? A book by Tracey Garvis Graves is always a sure thing. At least for me, it is. This was a delightful read with multiple tear-jerking moments. Both Wren and Marshall went on a journey with their anger, guilt, and grief and came out better. As time passed, I loved how an open communication developed between them. In my eyes, they both grew as a person, building a strong foundation that is needed for a true long-lasting relationship. This was a buddy-read with Jayme. Check out her amazing review.",

    sinopsis: "Fern Brookbanks has wasted far too much of her adult life thinking about Will Baxter. She spent just twenty-four hours in her early twenties with the aggravatingly attractive, idealistic artist, a chance encounter that spiraled into a daylong adventure in Toronto. The timing was wrong, but their connection was undeniable: they shared every secret, every dream, and made a pact to meet one year later. Fern showed up. Will didn't. At thirty-two, Fern's life doesn't look at all how she once imagined it would. Instead of living in the city, Fern's back home, running her mother's Muskoka lakeside resort--something she vowed never to do. The place is in disarray, her ex-boyfriend's the manager, and Fern doesn't know where to begin. She needs a plan--a lifeline. To her surprise, it comes in the form of Will, who arrives nine years too late, with a suitcase in tow and an offer to help on his lips. Will may be the only person who understands what Fern's going through. But how could she possibly trust this expensive suit-wearing mirage who seems nothing like the young man she met all those years ago. Will is hiding something, and Fern's not sure she wants to know what it is. But ten years ago, Will Baxter rescued Fern. Can she do the same for him?",

Fern knows she needs help managing the property but she doesn’t know if she wants to do it. Her life is in the big city, of Toronto. She has been living there for the last few years. Then, as if losing her mother was not enough shock, she learns her mother had hired a company to help her stay in the black and the person who shows up is none other than Will Baxter, the man she met ten years before and who broke her heart.Ten years earlier, Fern had the best day with Will. Will, who is an artist, is painting a mural in the coffee shop where she was working. As soon as they meet, a spark is there. Yet, both have a significant other but they make a pact to see each other a year later at the resort.  A year later, Fern is there but Will never shows up. In the present, Will is in front of her and she is still furious at him but she knows she needs his help if she wants to keep the business afloat or if she decides to sell. Meet Me at the Lake had 3 timelines if we count Fern's mom's diary entries and one main POV. It was easy to like Fern. I understood why she didn’t want to take over the resort after college. She wanted to do her own thing. I like Will except during the conflict. He didn’t act the way I thought he should. Overall, I did like it and I would read another romance by Carley Fortune.",

Lee Gulliver never thought she’d find herself living on the streets—no one ever does—but when her restaurant fails, and she falls deeper into debt, she leaves her old life behind with nothing but her clothes and her Toyota Corolla. In Seattle, she parks in a secluded spot by the beach to lay low and plan her next move—until early one morning, she sees a sobbing woman throw herself into the ocean. Lee hauls the woman back to the surface, but instead of appreciation, she is met with fury. The drowning woman, Hazel, tells her that she wanted to die, that she’s trapped in a toxic, abusive marriage, that she’s a prisoner in her own home. Lee has thwarted her one chance to escape her life. Out of options, Hazel retreats to her gilded cage, and Lee thinks she’s seen the last of her, until her unexpected return the next morning. Bonded by disparate but difficult circumstances, the women soon strike up a close and unlikely friendship. And then one day, Hazel makes a shocking request: she wants Lee to help her disappear.

She is in hiding after the man who helped her with the money to start her restaurant wants her to pay him back. She knows if he finds her, she won't live long. He has already shown her that he can hurt her. One morning, Lee is sleeping near the beach when she hears a woman cry. The woman, Hazel, is trying to drown herself. Lee doesn't think twice and jumps in the water to save her. Hazel is angry with her. She tells her she is a prisoner in her own home due to an abusive husband. However, the next morning Hazel shows up next to Lee's car. She thanks her for saving her life and brings food for Lee. They start meeting every morning. Lee starts to believe that things are turning for good. She considers Hazel to be a true friend and she meets a man named Jesse. He is sweet to her and very understanding of her situation. Then Hazel asks her to cover for her. She is tired of the abuse and she is ready to disappear. She asks Lee to dress like her and to replace her at home in front of all the cameras while she makes her escape. Then someone is murdered! I like that Robyn Harding provided us with both female POVs.  Lee and Hazel had in common that both wanted to disappear and escape their situations. Their ordeals sounded quite plausible. The Drowning Woman had a good couple of twists that kept the story moving forward and made it engaging from the very beginning.",

Noelle thought her grandmother told her everything during their Tell Me A Secret sessions but she never shared this one.

Now, Theo is a very successful businessman and she has nothing to show for all the time they have not seen each other. She feels like a failure. When Noelle learns that her grandmother had planned to marry Paul and they already had their honeymoon sketched, she decides she should do the trip her grandmother never got a chance to do. Paul asks to join her and Theo won't let Paul go alone so of course he decides to come too. You, With A View, was so freaking cute. Great debut romance with likable characters all around.

    sinopsis: "DESPERATELY SEEKING FICTIONAL HERO FOR HAPPILY EVER AFTER: Broke up with, broke, and with a vicious case of writer's block, romance writer Gracie Landing is a hot mess. She can hardly be blamed for drinking one (or a few) too many cocktails when out with her besties in an attempt to cheer herself up. Sometime in the foggy wee hours, she recklessly emails her unrequited high-school crush, Colin Yarmouth, who is now a successful attorney harboring regrets of his own. When she receives an intriguingly friendly (not to say flirty) response, her acute embarrassment is overcome only by her fervent curiosity―what would a hottie like Colin be like as a grown up? The two forge an unlikely friendship that's unmistakably headed for more. Colin's tales of his own woeful break-up become fodder for Gracie's fertile imagination and her current work-in-progress takes off. With the deadline looming and her checking account dwindling, Gracie has no idea that borrowing Colin's story could wreak havoc on her life, her career, and her own chance at happily-ever-after...",

    review: "A rom-com that some might enjoy. When Gracie Landing was in high school, she had a huge crush on her classmate, Colin Yarmouth who gave her nickname, Elvis, which stayed with her through the school years. Years later, Gracie is a romance novel writer but she is suffering from writer's block and can't seem to finish her next novel after her fiancée left her for their impregnated wedding planner. A late night with her girlfriends and after having too much to drink, she contacts Connor via email which she doesn't remember doing until the next morning. Connor, an estate attorney, is shocked to receive an email from Gracie. He remembers her from high school. Lately, his life has not been the greatest. He is recently divorced and this has impacted his life in more ways than one. After exchanging multiple emails with Gracie, Connor feels happier than he has been in a while. When he learns she is an author, he offers to read her latest manuscript. Later on, he spills the beans about his failed marriage and encourages Gracie to use it in her book. What starts as emails, leads to phone calls, which turn into in-person meetings and dates. The pair seem very happy with each other until an unlikely development. I had fun reading this one. Both of the characters were entertaining and having both POVs helped with their romance growth. However, I did feel that both, and especially Gracie acted immature for their age group which created unnecessary drama.",

Instead, she is confronted with meeting Sahvage, a vampire about to start fighting a human. Mae is in desperate need to find The Book. She needs a spell from it or she will lose everything. When Sahvage is harmed, she can't stay away and decides to help. Savage knows the Book and it's spells are a no-go. It can only bring more problems to the race. He knows  The Book needs to be destroyed but he also can’t let this female fight alone the evil that she has attracted and is near her. Another great couple has been added to the BDB series. I liked both main characters and the seeds planted for the next book involving Balthazar and Erika. ",

When Qhuinn gives his male the proposal of a lifetime, however, they are excited for their special night and more in love than ever. Everyone in the Black Dagger Brotherhood’s mansion gets into the preparations, and the after party takes on epic- and immortal- proportions when Lassiter forms the Party Planning Committee.

It is Christmas time and a blizzard is coming. The brothers all have to stay in and protect their homes from the elements. After the storm, despite close calls, they are all okay except for one. Besides the main storyline, we also meet two human girls. Their father’s BMW is stuck in the snow and the only way to get it out will be with the help of a tow guy in the form of Quinn. Yet things don’t go the way they should. I found A Warm Heart in Winter to be quite a tear-jerker in parts. Yet, as I mentioned earlier, it's hopeful too.  J. R. Ward is doing a great job at making me love Lassiter more with every book. I do have one request and it's that I would like to see these two young human girls show up in later books.  ",

Syn has kept his side hustle as a mercenary a secret from the Black Dagger Brotherhood. When he takes another hit job, he not only crosses the path of the vampire race’s new enemy, but also that of a half-breed in danger of dying during her transition. Jo Early has no idea what her true nature is, and when a mysterious man appears out of the darkness, she is torn between their erotic connection and the sense that something is very wrong. Fate anointed Butch O’Neal as the Dhestroyer, the fulfiller of the prophecy that foresees the end of the Omega. As the war with the Lessening Society comes to a head, Butch gets an unexpected ally in Syn. But can he trust the male—or is the warrior with the bad past a deadly complication? With time running out, Jo gets swept up in the fighting and must join with Syn and the Brotherhood against true evil. In the end, will love true prevail...or was the prophecy wrong all along?",

He enjoys it until he is asked to kill a news reporter by the name of Jo Every. When Syn meets Jo, he immediately can sense she is a half-vampire. He feels a connection with Jo and he will fight anyone in order to prevent anything bad from happening to her. Jo knows something is going on in Caldwell but the more she investigates the supernatural the more she develops memory losses. Something is going on with her health too. When she meets Syn she wants to trust him but she knows he is hiding something. The Sinner was a success! I liked the main characters and wanted them to survive the battle with the Omega. It warms my heart to see the Brotherhood and the Band of Bastards fighting together and the way their families keep on expanding. I sense the addition of a demon will cause trouble to the gang one way or the other.",

However, he is not prepared for what he must face in his quest for redemption. Dr. Sarah Watkins, researcher at a biomedical firm, is struggling with the loss of her fellow scientist fiancé. When the FBI starts asking about his death, she questions what really happened and soon learns the terrible truth: Her firm is conducting inhumane experiments in secret and the man she thought she knew and loved was involved in the torture. As Murhder and Sarah’s destinies become irrevocably entwined, desire ignites between them. But can they forge a future that spans the divide separating the two species?

Anyway, this is the love story of Murhder and Sarah. Other prominent characters include John Matthews and Xhex. Sarah is a scientist working in a lab at Biomed. She discovers that experiments have been occurring in a young male patient. Her fiancée died two years earlier of an insulin overdose. She was devastated when it happened but now she wonders if he knew what was going on at the lab. Murhder was part of the BDB but he was expelled after murdering humans. Warth believed he was crazy. For the past two decades, he has been living in exile in SC and running a B&B but not really living. Then he receives letters that can help him right a wrong and Murhder is ready for this. The BDB is the only one who can help him. During his search, he will cross paths with Sarah. Their connection is instant but can they have a future together? Emotional at times, and with plenty of action at others, J. R. Ward has created an amazing world that I’m always glad to revisit. Murhder and Sarah made a great couple together I also enjoyed the second major storyline with John Matthew and  Xhex. It tied well together with the main couple.

Malcolm Gephardt, handsome and gregarious longtime bartender at the Half Moon, has always dreamed of owning a bar. When his boss finally retires, Malcolm stretches to buy the place. He sees unquantifiable magic and potential in the Half Moon and hopes to transform it into a bigger success, but struggles to stay afloat. His smart and confident wife, Jess, has devoted herself to her law career. After years of trying for a baby, she is facing the idea that motherhood may not be in the cards for her. Like Malcolm, she feels her youth beginning to slip away and wonders how to reshape her future. Award-winning author Mary Beth Keane’s new novel takes place over the course of one week when Malcolm learns shocking news about Jess, a patron of the bar goes missing, and a blizzard hits the town of Gillam, trapping everyone in place.

She is a therapist who likes to help people but is unable to help herself. She lives in her pink house alone with the memories of happier times. Frankie is the prison librarian. She has a secret. Frankie did a bad thing but for a good reason. Frankie suffers from anxiety and the only thing that helps her is counting. Patience works at the senior care center where she does housekeeping. She befriends Edith and saves her dog. However, she is hiding who she really is. Then a murder happens. 'Three suspects, two murders, and one victim.' DCI Chapman is called in to process the scene. She believes Clio, Patience, or Frankie are involved and all she has to do now is prove it. The novel has several POVs and past and present chapters. The story flows and the characters are all very original and interesting. The last few twists were freaking amazing and the narration by Katherine Press and Stephanie Racine was superb!

What is not to like? Now back to what the novel is about.... After That Night brings more heartache for Sara Linton. If you follow this series, you know that Sara is currently Will's fiancee and that about 15 years ago, she was raped at Grady's while she was a resident. This event changed her future. Instead of becoming a pediatric cardiothoracic surgeon, she moved back home and joined the local pediatrician. A few years back, she moved back to Atlanta after another shocking event in her life, and during one of her ER shifts, she tried to save the life of a young woman, Dani Cooper, who had been brutally attacked. Before dying, Dani whispered that she was raped. Only Sara heard her. At present, Sara is testifying about the case fulfilling the promise she made to Dani and herself that she was going to do anything to make the man who attacked her pay. To her surprise, the attacker's mother tells Sara that her rape and the attack on Dani are all linked! 'Don't you remember the mixer?' This statement will shock her to her core and will make Will and his partner Faith Mitchell, start their own investigation into the matter before presenting the case to Amanda, their boss. A lot of intrigue in this one as well as women's violence although not as graphic as other books I read by her. I liked how solid Will and Sara have become as a couple. Also, how Will has learned how to engage with Faith. He knows when she needs time or when he needs to press for her to open up. Was I shocked by the ending? Nope, not at all. The clues were all there. I can't wait for the next book. Probably a murder during Sara and Will's wedding. One can only hope...",

Lucas Davenport at the BCA promised him, 'We'll only give you the hard stuff.' Flowers has been doing the hard stuff for three years now — but never anything like this. In the small town of Bluestem, a house way up on a ridge explodes into flames, its owner, a man named Judd, trapped inside. There is a lot of reason to hate him, Flowers discovers. Years ago, Judd had perpetrated a scam that'd driven a lot of local farmers out of business, even to suicide. There are also rumors of some very dicey activities with other men's wives, of involvement with some nutcase religious guy, and of an out-of-wedlock daughter. In fact, you'd probably have to dig around to find a person who didn't despise him. That wasn't even the reason Flowers had come to Bluestem. Three weeks before, there'd been another murder — two, in fact. There hadn't been a murder in Bluestem in years — and now suddenly three? But just how personal is something even he doesn't realize, and may not find out until too late. Because the next victim... may be himself. Librarian's note: as of 2021, there are 13 volumes in the author's Virgil Flowers series. The last was published in April 2021.

He likes to wear music band T-shirts instead of suits. He also has 3 ex-wives but the failed marriages have not made him bitter. Furthermore, he likes the ladies, and the ladies like him back. I was pleased with Dark of the Moon as the first installment and I enjoyed how Virgil handled himself. I'm sure he is only going to get better.

Through the app, and after the joint agreement that they are absolutely not interested in each other, Jack and Hallie become partners in their respective searches for The One. They text each other about their dates, often scheduling them at the same restaurant so that if things don’t go well, the two of them can get tacos afterward. Spoiler: they get a lot of tacos together. Discouraged by the lack of prospects, Jack and Hallie make a wager to see who can find true love first, but when they agree to be fake dates for a weekend wedding, all bets are off.

This leads to Jack breaking up with her and instead spending the rest of the time with Hallie. One thing leads to another or should I say, one drink leads to another, and Jack and Hallie will spend a one-night stand together. Yet, this is not the end for this pair. They will meet again while using an app known for finding true love and meeting 'The One'. At first, their interactions are messages, then texts, and then phone calls. Their conversations are about everything including sharing their bad dates from the app and deciding to meet after those dates to discuss what went wrong while eating tacos together. You can guess what happens next. Hallie and Jack both start developing feelings for each other but what is the best course of action? Ruin the friendship they have and enjoyed or try to become a couple and wish for the best. Love both characters, their banter, and their very real friendship. Also, I loved how perfect they were for each other. I can't wait to read a new book in this series. Will it be about Hallie's roommate? She seems like an awesome character.",

Her sister Leah has taken everything from her for as long as Megan can remember. Then Megan discovers Leah's latest betrayal and she loses it.

    sinopsis: "Years ago, a reclusive mega-bestselling children’s author quit writing under mysterious circumstances. Suddenly he resurfaces with a brand-new book and a one-of-a-kind competition, offering a prize that will change the winner’s life in this absorbing and whimsical novel. Make a wish. . . . Lucy Hart knows better than anyone what it’s like to grow up without parents who loved her. In a childhood marked by neglect and loneliness, Lucy found her solace in books, namely the Clock Island series by Jack Masterson. Now a twenty-six-year-old teacher’s aide, she is able to share her love of reading with bright, young students, especially seven-year-old Christopher Lamb, who was left orphaned after the tragic death of his parents. Lucy would give anything to adopt Christopher, but even the idea of becoming a family seems like an impossible dream without proper funds and stability. But be careful what you wish for. . . . Just when Lucy is about to give up, Jack Masterson announces he’s finally written a new book. Even better, he’s holding a contest at his home on the real Clock Island, and Lucy is one of the four lucky contestants chosen to compete to win the one and only copy. For Lucy, the chance of winning the most sought-after book in the world means everything to her and Christopher. But first she must contend with ruthless book collectors, wily opponents, and the distractingly handsome (and grumpy) Hugo Reese, the illustrator of the Clock Island books. Meanwhile, Jack “the Mastermind” Masterson is plotting the ultimate twist ending that could change all their lives forever. . . . You might just get it.",

    review: "The Wishing Game touched all my heartstrings! The Wishing Game stars Lucy Hart. She is a woman in her twenties, working as a teacher's aide. She loves her job but she mostly loves her time with one student, Christopher Lamb. He is a seven-year-old boy who has lost his parents and is in foster care. Lucy dreams of becoming Christopher's foster mother and then adopting him. Yet, her economic and living situation makes the dream impossible. When Lucy was a kid, she ran away from home. She went to Clock Island for the sole purpose of becoming Jack Masterson's sidekick. Jack Masterson is the famous author of the children's series called Clock Island. While on the island, Lucy also met Jack's young book illustrator, Hugo Reese. In the present, Jack has not written a new book in the last few years but Lucy introduced the Clock Island books to Christopher after the loss of his parents. To their shock, an announcement is made and Jack has written a new book and has started a contest and one of four lucky contestants will have the chance to win the new novel. Furthermore, Lucy is one of the four contestants. She and Christopher are ecstatic. This gives hope to Lucy. If she wins, she can use the book to get money to help her become Christopher's mom. The Wishing Game was adorable. It was easy to fall for all the main characters. Lucy, Christopher, Hugo, and Jack all had an important part to play. As a huge book lover, the idea of books helping through difficult times is relevant and truthful.",

    sinopsis: "FBI Agent Atlee Pine’s harrowing search for her long-lost sister Mercy reaches a boiling point in this breakneck thriller from #1 New York Times bestselling author David Baldacci.For her entire life, FBI agent Atlee Pine has been searching for her twin sister, Mercy, who was abducted at the age of six and never seen again. Mercy’s disappearance left behind a damaged family that later shattered beyond repair when Atlee’s parents inexplicably abandoned her. Now, after a perilous investigation that nearly proved fatal, Atlee has finally discovered not only the reason behind her parents’ abandonment and Mercy’s kidnapping, but also the most promising breakthrough yet: proof that Mercy survived her abduction and then escaped her captors many years ago. Though Atlee is tantalizingly close to her family at last, the final leg of her long road to Mercy will be the most treacherous yet. Mercy left at least one dead body behind before fleeing her captors years before. Atlee has no idea if her sister is still alive, and if so, how she has been surviving all this time. When the truth is finally revealed, Atlee Pine will face the greatest danger yet, and it may well cost her everything.",
    imageR: mrsleifReview,
    review: "This is the conclusion to the Atlee Pine series. If you have read the first 3 books, you know Atlee is an FBI agent. She is also a great fighter and an even better weightlifter. At the age of six, someone came into her room and kidnapped her twin sister Mercy and hurt Atlee badly enough that she ended up in the hospital for a while. Clues discovered during the prior books have led Atlee and her friend Carol Blum to believe that Mercy might be alive and that she was able to escape her captors. Atlee knows she needs to find out the truth and she hopes her sister is alive and she can get to her before it's too late. Mercy was a great way to end the series. Baldacci has created great female characters in this last installment. The novel was action-filled and the suspense continued to increase all the way to the end. I'm sad this is the end of the road for Atlee. I wouldn't mind reading more books about her solving cases.",

    sinopsis: "In this thriller from Alex Finlay, What Have We Done is a tale about the lives we leave behind and the secrets we carry with us forever: a stay-at-home mom with a past; a has-been rock star with a habit, a reality TV producer with a debt. Three disparate lives. One deadly secret. Twenty five years ago, Jenna, Donnie, and Nico were the best of friends, having forged a bond through the abuse and neglect they endured as residents of Savior House, a group home for parentless teens. When the home was shut down―after the disappearance of several kids―the three were split up. Though the trauma of their childhood has never left them, each went on to live accomplished―if troubled―lives. They haven’t seen one another since they were teens but now are reunited for a single haunting reason: someone is trying to kill them. To survive, the group will have to revisit the nightmares of their childhoods and confront their shared past―a past that holds the secret to why someone wants them dead. It’s a reunion none of them asked for . . . or wanted. But it may be the only way to save all their lives. What Have We Done is both an edge-of-your-seat thriller and a gut-wrenching coming-of-age story. And it cements Alex Finlay as one of the new leading voices in thrillers today.",
    imageR: mrsleifReview,
    review: "So I enjoyed this one. Maybe because for once I knew what I was getting into. What Have We Done tells the story of Jenna and the friends she made when she became an orphan and was sent to the Savoir House for teenagers. During this time, the children there endured bullying, and then girls started to disappear. Now as an adult, Jenna is married and has two stepchildren. She also has a past and a secret. Donnie was a rock star...now not so much. He has a problem with addiction and is on the brink of losing it at all. Nico is a successful reality TV show producer but with a gambling problem. The three of them will have to meet again after so many years when someone is targeting them. The past is catching up with them. They have a bullseye on their back. Narrated by mostly 3 POVs and two sets of timelines, this novel is fast-paced and has enough action to keep you going. Despite being a different type of story from Alex Finlay's earlier work, I was entertained.",

Then we go back a year and meet the neighbors of Alton Road and little by little we discovered their secrets. Alex Fox lives on Alton Road with her husband Nick and her daughter Lettie. Alex's sister. Emily Adair lives on the same road with her husband Ken and their son Dylan. A young and beautiful widow, Brooke Bailey. A couple in the middle of a divorce, Wilow and Evan Thompson, and their daughter, Riley. Last but not least are the new neighbors, Samir and Mandy Kumar, and their son, Jay, Lettie immediately has an interest in him. There is a dual POV. One by Alex and another by her daughter, Lettie. Lettie is smart and snarky. Alex is nice, she tries to help everyone but she might like alcohol a little too much. Brooke has a reputation. Some people believe that she murdered her husband. Emily is having some marital issues and she didn't like how interested Ken is in newcomer Mandy. For a lover of the show Desperate Housewives, I had fun with this one. The Block Party was full of twists and turns making it quite addicting. I liked Alex's character a lot and I felt bad for her alcoholism. Lettie was great too. Although sometimes she acted like a brat to her parents, especially her mom. The narrators Megan Tusing and Suzy Jackson did an amazing job of bringing all the characters to life. The conclusion was quite satisfying since it brings all the answers to the table.",

    sinopsis: "Six women--mothers, daughters, sisters--gone missing. When the first is found floating dead in the river, it reveals the disturbing truth of a small Ohio town. Inspired by the unsolved murders of the Chillicothe Six, this harrowing and haunting novel tells the story of two sisters, both of whom could be the next victims, from the internationally-bestselling author of Betty. Arcade and Daffodil are twin sisters born one minute apart. With their fiery red hair and thirst for an escape, they forge an unbreakable bond nurtured by both their grandmother's stories and their imaginations. Together, they create a world where a patch of grass reveals an archaeologist's dig, the smoke emerging from the local paper mill becomes the dust rising from wild horses galloping on the ground, and an abandoned 1950s convertible transforms into a time machine that can take them anywhere. But the two sisters can't escape the generational chaos that grips their family. Growing up in the shadow of the town, the sisters cling tight to one another. As an adult, Arcade wrestles with these memories of her life, just as a local woman is discovered drowned in the river. Soon, more bodies are found. While her friends disappear around her, Arcade is forced to reckon with the past while the killer circles ever closer. Arcade's promise to keep herself and her sister safe becomes increasingly desperate while the powerful riptide of the savage side becomes more difficult to resist. Drawing from the true story of women killed in her native Ohio, acclaimed novelist and poet Tiffany McDaniel has written a powerful literary testament and fearless elegy for missing women everywhere.",

    review: "I'm an outlier for this one. I did not enjoy On the Savage Side. I was hoping for a different type of book. This was a dark novel without hope. On the Savage Side was inspired by the murders of the Chillicothe Six. I was hoping to see more justice for these women in the novel since in real life the actual women who were murdered have not had it since two of the missing women are still missing, presumed dead but no body has been recovered. What rang true was the lack of worry the police felt about trying to find who was killing the prostitutes and drug addicts. The main character is Arc Doggs. She has a twin named Daffy. They live with their mother and aunt. Both prostitutes and heroin drug addicts. The twins experience child and sexual abuse. They grow up poor and without anyone helping them after their grandmother is killed. So as teenagers, they succumb to drugs and to be able to afford their addiction they become prostitutes themselves. As I said earlier this book was not for me. The prose was slow and the novel was full of imagery, symbolism, and constant metaphors. Too much for my taste.",

One of the siblings couldn't tolerate the idea of someone else replacing their mother (who killed herself many years ago) so January was violently attacked. Per their father, January was able to be fixed and her memory was wiped out completely about the event. In the present, all the siblings have received an anonymous letter saying their mother was murdered. At first, they don't share the information but as the time together progresses, they will learn that they all got the same note. I enjoyed this one so much. Love January and Six (the bot next door). From the Jaggers, I was very interested in Jada and her true crime obsession with the Freezer man (hoping there is a book about that). I thought Jesse needed mental health for life.

Generations of witches have been waiting for centuries for the seven spoons to come together, igniting a new era, and restoring women to their rightful power.

Lucky is in possession of a special spoon that has the letters Salem inscribed in it. As soon as Lucky touches the spoon, she feels differently.

She brings her grandmother with her and when they arrive at their destination they meet five women who are living together.

His name is Jay Christos, and he wants all the witches to die. He is responsible for the death of many and he is on the hunt for the last seven.

Unbeknownst to Atlee, she was interfering with a military bust by nonother than John Puller, military CID. Feeling intrigued about where John Puller's case was taking them, she decides to stay and help with the investigation, hoping to find more clues about Mercy in the process. Baldacci can make you root for his characters every single time. Atlee has become a quick favorite. A good FBI agent which for the most part uses her intellect but is not scared to use her strength to catch a bad guy. I haven't read the John Puller series but my husband is a fan and he was excited to see the crossover of worlds. By the end, we have more shocking discoveries and more clues into Mercy's fate. I can't wait to start the next one.",

    sinopsis: "Mia Thermopolis knows just what to do in a crisis: Rule. During the Covid-19 pandemic, a section of the diary of Princess Mia Thermopolis of Genovia fell into the hands of Meg Cabot, the Princess’s royal biographer. As reported in media outlets such as Entertainment Weekly, The Mary Sue, Refinery 29, Bustle, and more, from March until June of 2020, sixteen entries of the princess’s diary were leaked onto Ms. Cabot’s blog, to the delight of over a million fans. In these entries, titled The Coronavirus Princess Diaries, the princess recorded her most heartfelt emotions while dealing with her husband’s quarantine after exposure to the virus; her personal (and political) battles while imposing health restrictions on her small European nation; life during lockdown (even in as idyllic a location as a palace on the Riviera); and of course, dealing with her demanding royal family, especially her grandmother. Since then, readers have been clamoring for more chapters of Mia’s coronavirus diary . . . and here they are at last: The Quarantine Princess Diaries include not only the previously released entries (now edited and updated with new content), but two hundred more pages of entirely original, never-before-seen entries, including the princess’s worries over a possible royal affair; a showdown between Mia and Grandmère over the latter’s intended nuptials; the eventual development and distribution of a groundbreaking intranasal vaccine for every citizen in Genovia; and, as always, a royally happy ending.",

    review: "I have to say that I'm disappointed. I mean the Princess Diaries' first book was refreshing and cute. This one not so much. The novel is supposed to be about Princess Mia dealing with the pandemic arriving at her doorstep. In my opinion, the author had a great chance to give some substance to the characters instead the majority of the book is just fluff. No real conflict. Worse, Mia is still insecure about her husband Michael. She passes her time drinking wine in sweatpants.  She says she is worried about her family and the people of Genova but she doesn't do much except a couple of indictments to mandate masks and social distancing.  Worse,  all the fun of reading it went away between how political the book was and Mia making fun of Americans. No one is sadder that I didn't like it than myself. ",

    sinopsis: "Harriet and Wyn have been the perfect couple since they met in college—they go together like salt and pepper, honey and tea, lobster and rolls. Except, now—for reasons they’re still not discussing—they don’t. They broke up six months ago. And still haven’t told their best friends. Which is how they find themselves sharing the largest bedroom at the Maine cottage that has been their friend group’s yearly getaway for the last decade. Their annual respite from the world, where for one vibrant, blue week they leave behind their daily lives; have copious amounts of cheese, wine, and seafood; and soak up the salty coastal air with the people who understand them most. Only this year, Harriet and Wyn are lying through their teeth while trying not to notice how desperately they still want each other. Because the cottage is for sale and this is the last week they’ll all have together in this place. They can’t stand to break their friends’ hearts, and so they’ll play their parts. Harriet will be the driven surgical resident who never starts a fight, and Wyn will be the laid-back charmer who never lets the cracks show. It’s a flawless plan (if you look at it from a great distance and through a pair of sunscreen-smeared sunglasses). After years of being in love, how hard can it be to fake it for one week… in front of those who know you best? A couple who broke up months ago make a pact to pretend to still be together for their annual weeklong vacation with their best friends in this glittering and wise new novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Emily Henry.",
    imageR: mrsleifReview,
    review: "Happy Place is the latest book by Emily Henry. This one is about friendship and of course love too. It's about best friends who met in college and who reunite once a year to spend time together in Coastal Maine where so many of their memories have been created. The main couple is Harriet and Wyn who were best friends first, and after a year, they became more. Later on, engaged but in the present, they are not together anymore. Between two timelines past and present, we learned how they met, fell in love, and why they broke up. In the present when Harriet arrives, she is surprised to see Wyn there, she never thought she was going to see him there again. She is shocked, to say the least, but the shocks keep on coming, her friend Sabrina is going to marry at the end of the week and the house they have loved for so many years is being sold!! So of course Harriet and Wyn need to fake being still together not to upset the dynamics despite not being a couple for the last six months. Harriet still loves Wyn so she is not sure how to navigate the situation without getting hurt further. Happy Place had me wanting to go visit Maine right away and follow all the places they enjoyed and the food they ate. It also had me rooting for a happy ending for the main characters and for their friendship between the six to survive the passing of time.",

    review: "I enjoyed prior Kerry Wilkinson's books and I was excited to start a new series by this author. Millie Westlake volunteers at the nursing home where her friend Jack works. Millie lives in Whitecliff where everyone knows each other and gossip spreads faster than you can say hi. Millie is well known but not with affection but with recrimination. She has committed two crimes in the minds of the inhabitants. First, she cheated with a politician, broke her marriage, and lost the custody of her son when the affair was found out, The second crime is that they believed she killed her parents and she got away with it plus inherited their home after they passed. The only job Millie can have is being a dog groomer although the reviews left on the net are not as nice as she would like. One day, after spending time with Ingrid, a nursing home patient, she is told by Ingrid that the night before she saw a woman being pushed off the roof of a home close by through her window. Millie can't let it go and decides to investigate. This decision will put a target on her back but she can't stop digging with the help of Guy, an ex-reporter now blogger. I liked Millie, her story was intriguing and I wanted to know more about her affair, her parent's death, and of course, if a woman was truly pushed and why. The story grabbed me from the very beginning and I was happy with the way the novel unfolded. The narrator Helen Keeley did a great job of bringing the character to life. I will read the next one in the series and hope to see more of the characters. Hopefully, she can get her son back.",

    sinopsis: "In a strange little home built into the branches of a grove of trees, live three robots--fatherly inventor android Giovanni Lawson, a pleasantly sadistic nurse machine, and a small vacuum desperate for love and attention. Victor Lawson, a human, lives there too. They're a family, hidden and safe. The day Vic salvages and repairs an unfamiliar android labelled 'HAP,' he learns of a shared dark past between Hap and Gio-a past spent hunting humans. When Hap unwittingly alerts robots from Gio's former life to their whereabouts, the family is no longer hidden and safe. Gio is captured and taken back to his old laboratory in the City of Electric Dreams. So together, the rest of Vic's assembled family must journey across an unforgiving and otherworldly country to rescue Gio from decommission, or worse, reprogramming. Along the way to save Gio, amid conflicted feelings of betrayal and affection for Hap, Vic must decide for himself: Can he accept love with strings attached? Author TJ Klune invites you deep into the heart of a peculiar forest and on the extraordinary journey of a family assembled from spare parts.",

    review: "Another hit for T. J. Klune! In The Lives of Puppets, we are taken to a world in the future where robots run free. At the beginning of the story, we get to know the hero Victor, a young human living in a secluded home with his adopted father Gio, and two robots, Nurse Ratched and Rambo. Victor was the one who fixed Nurse Ratched and Rambo and he is always on the lookout for another machine he can reactivate. So when he finds an android who for a minute was still 'alive' before his battery stops, he knows he will do anything to fix the android who he names HAP (Hysterically Angry Puppet). At first, he hides him from GIO until HAP is fully operational. Without realizing by saving HAP, Victor has put his life in danger. Next thing he knows, androids are surrounding his home and GIO is taken prisoner to the City of Electric Dreams. Gio has left a message not to try to find him but Victor can't stop himself but embark on a trip to save the only father he has ever known. In regards to the characters, even though I care about Victor and root for his success and love HAP's evolution, my heart was stolen by Nurse Ratched and Rambo. Who doesn't love a nurse who can engage in an empathy protocol but truly has a murderous streak with the sole goal of drilling? And Rambo with his sweet disposition, innocence, ferocious loyalty, and the need to be brave? Worth mentioning is the narrator Danny Henning who does a marvelous job with these wonderful characters just like he did with Cerulean which is still my favorite of Klune's novels. Adorable characters that make you feel are the recipe for Klune's success. I can't wait for any of his books to become a movie.",

FBI Agent Atlee Pine's life was never the same after her twin sister Mercy was kidnapped--and likely killed--thirty years ago. After a lifetime of torturous uncertainty, Atlee's unresolved anger finally gets the better of her on the job, and she finds she has to deal with the demons of her past if she wants to remain with the FBI. Atlee and her assistant Carol Blum head back to Atlee's rural hometown in Georgia to see what they can uncover about the traumatic night Mercy was taken and Pine was almost killed. But soon after Atlee begins her investigation, a local woman is found ritualistically murdered, her face covered with a wedding veil--and the first killing is quickly followed by a second bizarre murder. Atlee is determined to continue her search for answers, but now she must also set her sights on finding a potential serial killer before another victim is claimed.

He knows Atlee needs to step away from work and look into her past to be able to move forward. Atlee decides to go back to Georgia. The last place she saw her twin sister, Mercy. They were six when a man came into their bedroom and took her and hit Mercy so hard that she ended up in the hospital with severe head trauma. However, during the trip down memory lane, Atlee is not alone. Her assistant Carol Plum is with her. Coming back home brings all kinds of feeling for Atlee and when she starts asking questions to the people who used to know her parents, she realizes more than one is hiding things from her making it harder for her to follow a trail. When a series of murders start occurring. Atlee lends a hand to the investigation. Another FBI agent is called to help out. He and Atlee have some history but they will put their feelings aside to help with the task at hand. Quite an interesting novel this was. Trying to figure out if the murders were related to Atle's sister's disappearance and what really happened all those years ago had me on my toes. As for the characters, Atlee was likable. She was a good agent. She was smart and logical without being the usual broken-need-fixing protagonist.  I also liked Carol. She was loyal to Atlee and always gave the support she needed but also made her see her faults when Atlee was making mistakes.",

'Mom seems off.' Her brother's words echo in Sam Montgomery's ear as she turns onto the quiet North Carolina street where their mother lives alone. She brushes the thought away as she climbs the front steps. Sam's excited for this rare extended visit, and looking forward to nights with just the two of them, drinking boxed wine, watching murder mystery shows, and guessing who the killer is long before the characters figure it out. But stepping inside, she quickly realizes home isn’t what it used to be. Gone is the warm, cluttered charm her mom is known for; now the walls are painted a sterile white. Her mom jumps at the smallest noises and looks over her shoulder even when she’s the only person in the room. And when Sam steps out back to clear her head, she finds a jar of teeth hidden beneath the magazine-worthy rose bushes, and vultures are circling the garden from above. To find out what’s got her mom so frightened in her own home, Sam will go digging for the truth. But some secrets are better left buried.",

Sam is excited to spend her time off watching crime tv shows and drinking wine. Sam's mother is usually a carefree, easy-going, and stress-free woman but when Sam sees her, she can't believe this thin, jumpy, and distracted person is her mother. In addition, her home feels off too. Her mother had painted all the walls white like when her Gran Mae was alive instead of the vibrant colors they were the last time she visited. Is her mother getting dementia or is someone harassing her? And why are all these crows watching the house and her every move? A House with Good Bones had an entertaining character to keep my interest throughout. The gothic elements were well-balanced. Furthermore, the narrator, Mary Robinette Kowal did a fantastic job of keeping things moving for me.",

    sinopsis: "A sweeping, tenderhearted love story, Beyond That, the Sea by Laura Spence-Ash tells the story of two families living through World War II on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean, and the shy, irresistible young woman who will call them both her own. As German bombs fall over London in 1940, working-class parents Millie and Reginald Thompson make an impossible choice: they decide to send their eleven-year-old daughter, Beatrix, to America. There, she’ll live with another family for the duration of the war, where they hope she’ll stay safe. Scared and angry, feeling lonely and displaced, Bea arrives in Boston to meet the Gregorys. Mr. and Mrs. G, and their sons William and Gerald, fold Bea seamlessly into their world. She becomes part of this lively family, learning their ways and their stories, adjusting to their affluent lifestyle. Bea grows close to both boys, one older and one younger, and fills in the gap between them. Before long, before she even realizes it, life with the Gregorys feels more natural to her than the quiet, spare life with her own parents back in England. As Bea comes into herself and relaxes into her new life—summers on the coast in Maine, new friends clamoring to hear about life across the sea—the girl she had been begins to fade away, until, abruptly, she is called home to London when the war ends. Desperate as she is not to leave this life behind, Bea dutifully retraces her trip across the Atlantic back to her new, old world. As she returns to post-war London, the memory of her American family stays with her, never fully letting her go, and always pulling on her heart as she tries to move on and pursue love and a life of her own. As we follow Bea over time, navigating between her two worlds, Beyond That, the Sea emerges as a beautifully written, absorbing novel, full of grace and heartache, forgiveness and understanding, loss and love.",

London is getting bombed regularly and her parents, Millie and Reggie decided to send her to America to live with a family in Boston. Millie doesn't want to send her but Reginald insists. He wants her daughter to be safe. When Bea arrives in Boston, the Gregorys are there to pick her up. She meets Mr. and Mrs. G and their sons, William and Gerald. William behaves like a regular teenager, angry at times, thinking about enlisting when he is of age, and desperate to leave the house and travel all over. Gerald is the youngest son. He is big-hearted and sweet. Even though both sons are so different, they both clicked with Bea, becoming one of them pretty quickly. Bea who starts as scared and angry towards her mother-teenager, blossoms into a wonderful young woman. She falls for William but when the war is over, she must return to London. Readjusting her life is not easy but she knows she has to continue her life although the Gregorys are never far from her mind. Heartbreak, death, divorce, and sorrow plague these two families and when it felt that there was no hope, a sliver will show up. Ell Potter, the narrator, helps bring Bea, Mrs. G and Millie alive. I thought she did a great job narrating them.",

When the book begins, a woman is by the cliff. As always, Gabe grabs a jacket and goes out there to talk to her and hopefully help her not jump. However, this time things don't work out and she dies. As traumatizing as this situation is for Pipa, it becomes worse when it's revealed that Gabe knew the victim and that Pipa knew her husband. The book is narrated by Pippa and by Amanda, the dead woman. Both characters unraveled the past and make sense of the present.

The older of her two daughters, Zadie, should have seen it coming, because she can literally see things coming. But not even her psychic abilities were able to prevent their mother from vanishing one morning. Zadie’s estranged younger sister, Finn, can’t see into the future, but she has an uncannily good memory, so good that she remembers not only her own memories, but the echoes of memories other people have left behind. On the afternoon of her graduation party, Finn is seized by an “echo” more powerful than anything she’s experienced before: a woman singing a song she recognizes, a song about a bird… When Finn wakes up alone in an aviary with no idea of how she got there, she realizes who the memory belongs to: Nora. Now, it’s up to Finn to convince her sister that not only is their mom still out there, but that she wants to be found. Against Zadie’s better judgement, she and Finn hit the highway, using Finn’s echoes to retrace Nora’s footsteps and uncover the answer to the question that has been haunting them for years: Why did she leave? But the more time Finn spends in their mother’s past, the harder it is for her to return to the present, to return to herself. As Zadie feels her sister start to slip away, she will have to decide what lengths she is willing to go to to find their mother, knowing that if she chooses wrong, she could lose them both for good.",

    review: "The Wilderwoman was likable but not engrossing. I listened to the audio and I think Anna Caputo's narration is the way to go with so many past and present chapters plus different POVs. She helped keep storylines straight for me. The novel revolves around two sisters. Zadie and Finn. Zadie Wilder is twenty-three and her sister Finn is seventeen. Five years ago, their mother, Nora walked out on them. The sisters get separated. Finn as an underage child is placed under foster care. Zadie is left to survive on her own. In the beginning, they tried to stay close but this doesn't last. Now that Finn is almost about to graduate, they have planned two weeks at the beach to bond again. Yet, Finn has an ulterior motive, she wants to search for her mother with Zadie. She believes her ability is going to help. Yes, you heard right, Finn has the ability to 'feel' past memories which she calls 'echoes'. Zadie is a psychic but she doesn't like to have an ability so she doesn't use it. The story follows these two women in search of their mother, interacting with interesting characters along the way. Even though magical realism is a favorite, I found myself uninterested at times. I also didn't think the reason for Nora's leaving was enough. The resolution felt rushed too.",

With its tumbling ivy and overgrown garden, the cottage is worlds away from the abusive partner who tormented Kate. But she begins to suspect that her great aunt had a secret. One that lurks in the bones of the cottage, hidden ever since the witch-hunts of the 17th century. 1619: Altha is awaiting trial for the murder of a local farmer who was stampeded to death by his herd. As a girl, Altha’s mother taught her their magic, a kind not rooted in spell casting but in a deep knowledge of the natural world. But unusual women have always been deemed dangerous, and as the evidence for witchcraft is set out against Altha, she knows it will take all of her powers to maintain her freedom. 1942: As World War II rages, Violet is trapped in her family's grand, crumbling estate. Straitjacketed by societal convention, she longs for the robust education her brother receives––and for her mother, long deceased, who was rumored to have gone mad before her death. The only traces Violet has of her are a locket bearing the initial W and the word weyward scratched into the baseboard of her bedroom.

    review: "I'm so late in writing this review but finally, here it goes. Three women. Three mistreated women are all linked by their resilience and ability to learn to survive in a world that is not friendly to them. in 1619, Altha Weyward is a teenager. Her mother has passed, she doesn't know her father and she is fighting for her life. She has been accused of witchcraft and killing a neighbor with her powers. How is she able to endure it? In 1942, Violet Ayres wanted more than what she was allowed. She craves knowledge. She wishes she could be like her brother and be able to learn what he is. Yet, she is told that marriage and having kids is her only purpose. Her father is unyielding and her mother has passed, rumored to have gone crazy. Then two things happen, one involving finding out about the Weywards' past, the other one, a traumatizing event that will change her future. In 2019, Kate Ayres is running away from his abusive partner. She runs to Weyward Cottage, a place she inherited from her great-aunt Violet. Little by little, she wants to know more about her great-aunt and her ancestors. What she learns baffles her but at the same time, it empowers her. Great writing combined with a realistic atmospheric setting made Weyward a winning novel for me. I liked all 3 women and was hoping for a good outcome for all of them. The narrators, Aysha Kala, Helen Keeley, and Nell Barlow only augmented the experience. This was a buddy read with Melissa and Terrie.",

Eliza and Graham find themselves flirting like it's their first date, and waiting with butterflies in their stomach for the other to text back. Everyone at the retreat can sense the electric chemistry between Eliza and Graham's alter egos. But when their scintillating game of roleplaying ends, will they still feel the heat? When a couple starts to feel like they're married to a stranger, a flirtatious game of pretend becomes the spark they need to reignite their relationship.",

    review: "This is a different type of romance. It's about a married couple trying to rekindle their love for each other. Eliza and Graham are about to celebrate their 5th anniversary. Graham's mother has gifted them a week at a resort in northern California. However, if their ride over there is any indication, their marriage is doomed. Graham is an attorney and Eliza is a voice-over actor. They are successful in their professional life but not in their personal. It seems that the couple doesn't know how to talk to each other any longer. Due to a new acquaintance, an unexpected circumstance arises. David mistakes them as single and introduces Graham to Eliza. The couple takes this chance and begins the role-play of being strangers. For the next few days, they treat their relationship as new, including staying in separate rooms and only seeing each other by chance. This definitely was not Two For the Road but the writing was witty. I did get invested in Eliza and Graham. I was rooting for them to be able to find each other again. I enjoyed both narrators, Dan Bittner and Brittany Pressley. They grab the characters and made them their own.",

    sinopsis: "A mother questions everything she knows about her son when a local woman is found dead. Valerie has been forgetting things. Her daughter worries about her being on her own in her big Victorian house—one rumored to be haunted after a tragedy decades earlier—and truth be told, she is a little lonely. With few options, she asks her adult son to move home, but it’s not quite the reunion she hoped for. Hudson is taciturn, moody and frequently gone. The neighbors already hold a grudge against Hudson, and they aren’t happy about his return. When a young woman is found murdered a block away, suspicion falls on him immediately, without a shred of evidence. While Valerie fights to defend her son, she begins to wonder who she really invited into her home. It’s a horrible thing for a mother to even think…but is it possible she’s enabled a monster? A monster she is living with, alone?",

    review: "I liked A Mother Would Know. Valerie is distressed about her memory. Her mother had Alzheimer's and she saw what the disease did to her. She'd rather not find out. Valerie's daughter, Kendra worries about her health and living alone but Valerie doesn't want to leave her home. So instead when her son needs a place to crash, she is more than happy for him to stay with her. Yet, the neighborhood disagrees. You see, years prior the next-door neighbor's daughter's death was associated with Hudson since he was her boyfriend. Valerie worries about Hudson. She remembers some incidents when Hudson was growing up that perturbed her and of course, she knows about Helen, the girlfriend that died. Making matters worse, two new deaths occurred in the neighborhood and they have a connection to Hudson. What is she going to do? I listened to the audio and Vivienne Leheny helped keep things straight between the past and the present. The majority of the book is narrated by Valerie. She is an unreliable narrator due to her memory loss. I felt bad for her. She was in an impossible position. Do you believe your son is a killer or are you a terrible mother for thinking it?",

    sinopsis: "Author and single mom Finlay Donovan has been in messes before―after all, she's a pro at removing bloodstains for various unexpected reasons―but none quite like this. When Finlay and her nanny/partner-in-crime Vero accidentally destroyed a luxury car that they had 'borrowed' in the process of saving the life of Finlay's ex-husband, the Russian mob did her a favor and bought the car for her. And now Finlay owes them. Mob boss Feliks is still running the show from behind bars, and he has a task for Finlay: find and identify a contract killer before the cops do. The problem is, the killer might be an officer themself. Luckily, hot cop Nick has just been tasked with starting up a citizen's police academy, and combined pressure from Finlay's looming book deadline and Feliks is enough to convince Finlay and Vero to get involved. Through firearm training and forensic classes (and some hands-on research with a tempting detective), Finlay and Vero use their time in police academy to sleuth out the real contract killer to free themselves from the mob's clutches―all the while dodging spies, confronting Vero's past, and juggling the daily trials of parenthood.",

    review: "I listened to the audio and it made me laugh so many times. I can picture Vero and Finlay in all the crazy situations they get themselves into. This time, Finlay and Vero are in dire straights from different baddies. The Russian mob leader, Feliks wants Finlay to find Easy Clean. Finlay has no clue how to do it but she believes Easy Clean might be a cop and she still suspects Joey, Nick's partner. Vero owes money to people in Atlantic City and they are coming for payment. So what do they do, they decide to join the one-week police academy for civilians and lay low while investigating who is Easy Clean. It's always nice to get back into this crazy world. I love Finlay and Vero. I also liked Nick and Javi. I like Finlay's sister Georgia who now has a love interest. I still don't trust Finlay's ex-husband, Steven. He is hiding something. There is also a cameo of a certain law student and I was kind of sad Finlay was done with him. In my opinion, this series should be read in order, otherwise, you might not get too many spoilers at once or not appreciate the craziness Finlay lives in.",

Growing up in a beautiful house in the English countryside, Katie Shaw lived a charmed life. At the cusp of graduation, she had big dreams, a devoted boyfriend, and a little brother she protected fiercely. Until the day a violent stranger changed the fate of her family forever. Years later, still unable to live down the guilt surrounding what happened to her brother, Chris, and now with a child of her own to protect, Katie struggles to separate the real threats from the imagined. Then she gets the phone call: Chris has gone missing and needs his big sister once more. Meanwhile, Detective Laurence Page is facing a particularly gruesome crime. A distinguished professor of fate and free will has been brutally murdered just hours after firing his staff. All the leads point back to two old cases: the gruesome attack on teenager Christopher Shaw, and the despicable crimes of a notorious serial killer who, legend had it, could see the future.",
    imageR: mrsleifReview,
    review: "I was excited to read The Angel Maker. Even better was getting the audiobook narrated by Rosalie Craig! What was the novel about? Hmm..I guess first we have to talk about the main characters. First, there is Katie Show she is a mother, a little overprotective but she knows that bad things can happen when you are not careful. She might be having marital problems because of all her worrying. Her brother Chris Show has been estranged from her. He was an addict. He had a lot of self-esteem issues growing up. In the year 2000 when he was a young boy, he was attacked by a man, Michael Hyde who was driving a red car. The man doesn't know why he decided to attack him. For Chris, the scars on the inside are much worse than the scars on his face and body. Third, there is detective, Laurence Page. He will be the cop involved in solving the murder of professor Alan Hobbes. Detective Page has a link to the Shows. He was one of the officers in 2000 who were there after the attack on Christopher. Alan Hobbes used to be a philosophy professor who wanted his students to decide if things were all predetermined or not. He also had the biggest collection of items owned by the Angel Maker serial killer, Jack Lock. The question is why? Truly an enjoyable thriller. I was worried about who was going to survive the evil that was lurking and I was hoping for both Chris and Katie to survive. The novel does make you wonder if you believe in fate or in free will. Maybe a little bit of both?",

    sinopsis: "Mariah Fredericks's The Lindbergh Nanny is powerful, propulsive novel about America’s most notorious kidnapping through the eyes of the woman who found herself at the heart of this deadly crime. When the most famous toddler in America, Charles Lindbergh, Jr., is kidnapped from his family home in New Jersey in 1932, the case makes international headlines. Already celebrated for his flight across the Atlantic, his father, Charles, Sr., is the country’s golden boy, with his wealthy, lovely wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, by his side. But there’s someone else in their household—Betty Gow, a formerly obscure young woman, now known around the world by another name: the Lindbergh Nanny. A Scottish immigrant deciphering the rules of her new homeland and its East Coast elite, Betty finds Colonel Lindbergh eccentric and often odd, Mrs. Lindbergh kind yet nervous, and Charlie simply a darling. Far from home and bruised from a love affair gone horribly wrong, Betty finds comfort in caring for the child, and warms to the attentions of handsome sailor Henrik, sometimes known as Red. Then, Charlie disappears. Suddenly a suspect in the eyes of both the media and the public, Betty must find the truth about what really happened that night, in order to clear her own name—and to find justice for the child she loves.",
    imageR: mrsleifReview,
    review: "This was an interesting historical fiction novel. The book is narrated by Charlie Lindbergh's nanny, Betty Gow before he was kidnapped and months later found dead. In 1939, Betty Gow is taking care of the baby when he disappears from his crib at night. A ramson note is left behind. When the police start investigating the crime, they immediately zoom in on Betty and make her a suspect. She was the last person to see the baby alive, she was a single woman going out with a Norwegian sailor named Henry, and she was a foreigner. In Betty's words, she describes how she got the position of a nanny. She didn't like Charles Lindbergh. She thought he was an odd man. She especially didn't like the way he treated baby Charlie. The child's mother, Anne Morrow was a nice woman but Betty couldn't understand how she could leave the child for weeks at a time and then wondered why the child would cling to the nanny and not to her when she came back. The Lindbergh Nanny had my attention from the very first page since it's based on a truly horrible crime with too many unanswered questions. Was it an inside job? Probably. Do I believe Betty had something to do with it? I doubt it.",

The twenty-five-year-old American grad student rose to instant notoriety when he confessed to the slaughter of his classmate Liam Stewart, claiming the Devil made him do it. When Hale is found hanged in his prison cell, officers uncover a handwritten manuscript that promises to answer the question that’s haunted the nation for years: was Hale a lunatic, or had he been telling the truth all along? Unnervingly, Hale doesn’t fit the bill of a killer. The first-person narrative that centers this novel reveals an acerbic young atheist, newly enrolled at the University of Edinburgh to carry on the legacy of his recently deceased father. In need of cash, he takes a job ghostwriting a mysterious book for a dark stranger, but has misgivings when the project begins to reawaken his satanophobia, a rare condition that causes him to live in terror that the Devil is after him. As he struggles to disentangle fact from fear, Grayson’s world is turned upside-down after events force him to confront his growing suspicion that he’s working for the one he has feared all this time—and that the book is only the beginning of their partnership.​​ A History of Fear is a propulsive foray into the darkness of the human psyche, marrying dread-inducing atmosphere and heart-palpitating storytelling.

As a teenager, he became an atheist. When his father passes. Grayson decides to go to Scotland, a place his father had visited as a young man. Grayson believes living there will bring him closer to his father. Then a stranger asks him to become a ghostwriter for a novel about the devil.

A judge, Julia Cummins, and her bodyguard, Alan Draymont have been found murdered and the FBI sends Amos and Freddie to Florida to investigate. Amos knows something doesn't add up. The judge was stabbed to death and the bodyguard was shot instead. Are there two killers? Glad Amos was back and I'm glad Freddie is his new partner.

She is a captive and the only thing left behind is a cellphone with only one number. When she dials it, she gets a man named Bud on the other line. Bud is a construction worker.

When Violet dials him, at first he thinks it's all a joke but he can't shake the desperation he hears in the voice on the other side of the line. Soon, he is playing detective and trying to figure out, who captured her and why. He wants to help Violet get free. Violet is Nowhere is a good installment but not as good as Amen Maxine.

    publisher: "Publisher: St. Martin's Press",
    imageS: mrsleifSinopsis,
    sinopsis: "From New York Times bestselling author Rachel Hawkins comes a deliciously wicked gothic suspense, set at an Italian villa with a dark history, for fans of Lucy Foley and Ruth Ware. As kids, Emily and Chess were inseparable. But by their 30s, their bond has been strained by the demands of their adult lives. So when Chess suggests a girls trip to Italy, Emily jumps at the chance to reconnect with her best friend. Villa Aestas in Orvieto is a high-end holiday home now, but in 1974, it was known as Villa Rosato, and rented for the summer by a notorious rock star, Noel Gordon. In an attempt to reignite his creative spark, Noel invites up-and-coming musician, Pierce Sheldon to join him, as well as Pierce’s girlfriend, Mari, and her stepsister, Lara. But he also sets in motion a chain of events that leads to Mari writing one of the greatest horror novels of all time, Lara composing a platinum album––and ends in Pierce’s brutal murder. As Emily digs into the villa’s complicated history, she begins to think there might be more to the story of that fateful summer in 1974. That perhaps Pierce’s murder wasn’t just a tale of sex, drugs, and rock & roll gone wrong, but that something more sinister might have occurred––and that there might be clues hidden in the now-iconic works that Mari and Lara left behind. Yet the closer that Emily gets to the truth, the more tension she feels developing between her and Chess. As secrets from the past come to light, equally dangerous betrayals from the present also emerge––and it begins to look like the villa will claim another victim before the summer ends.",
    imageR: mrsleifReview,
    review: "Another good novel by Rachel Hawkins. The Villa is narrated by two characters: Mari in 1974 and Emily in the present. Emily and Chess have been friends since they were kids. Through the years, they have stayed in touch but they haven't been able to spend quality time together in a long time. Emily is a writer of cozy mysteries. Her series' love interest is based on her ex-husband and because of it, she is having a hard time starting her next book without killing the character. On the other hand, Chess has become a very famous and successful self-help writer. When Chess invites Emily to spend a few weeks in Orvieto, Italy, Emily decides to go. Not long after arriving in Italy, Emily becomes quite intrigued by Villa Aestas' history. She learns the house has been the site of a murder in 1974. Emily starts thinking that a book and an album might have clues about what really happened that fateful day. In the 1970s, Villa Aestas was known as Villa Rosato. Here a famous singer Noel Gordon stayed with Pierce Sheldon, his girlfriend Mari, and her stepsister, Lara. After Pierce is murdered, Mary writes the greatest horror novel of all time and Lara will compose a platinum album that everybody has heard and most own. The question is: Is the person who killed Pierce really the man accused of the crime or perhaps there is more to the story. I enjoyed the two timelines and the two main characters. I liked how the story progressed. We are able to learn how things occurred in 1974 although when you think you know everything, you really don't. I've been a fan of  Rachel Hawkins since her Hex Hall series and now I'm a fan of her thrillers. Lastly, if someone from Netflix is reading this review, I think the Villa could be a great movie!",

    sinopsis: "The Renaissance Faire is on the move, and Lulu and Dex are along for the ride, in the next utterly charming rom-com from Jen DeLuca. A high-powered attorney from a success-oriented family, Louisa 'Lulu' Malone lives to work, and everything seems to be going right, until the day she realizes it’s all wrong. Lulu’s cousin Mitch introduced her to the world of Renaissance Faires, and when she spies one at a time just when she needs an escape, she leaps into the welcoming environment of turkey legs, taverns, and tarot readers. The only drawback? Dex MacLean: a guitarist with a killer smile, the Casanova of the Faire… and her traveling companion for the summer. Dex has never had to work for much in his life, and why should he? Touring with his brothers as The Dueling Kilts is going great, and he always finds a woman at every Faire. But when Lulu proves indifferent to his many plaid charms and a shake-up threatens the fate of the band, Dex must confront something he never has before: his future. Forced to spend days and nights together on the road, Lulu’s interest in the kilted bad boy grows as he shows her a side of himself no one else has seen. The stresses of her old lifestyle fade away as she learns to trust her intuition and follow her heart instead of her head. But when her time on the road is over, will Lulu go with her gut, or are she and Dex destined for separate paths?",

    review: "Super cute! I liked this series and Well Traveled delivers a believable romance despite happing in the Renaissance Faire. Louisa 'Lulu' Malone is an attorney and in order to become a partner she has been working nonstop. When her boss calls her, she's at the Renaissance Faire. She has been working all day and she finally decided to spend some time walking through the Faire which brings her happy memories. When her boss tells her she needs to go back to work, she realizes she's never gonna become a partner and she decides to quit and gets rid of her phone. When she realizes she's out of a job and starts to panic, luckily there is Stacy who knows her cousin Mitch and who offers to take her traveling with the Faire for a few weeks. Stacy recognizes that disengaging from her laptop and her phone can help her realize what she wants to do next. She knows she does not want to do the same thing she has been doing for the last few years. As part of the characters, she meets Dex who is part of the Dueling Kilts. He has a reputation for being a lady's man but as we get to know him we discover that he has some layers that no one has been willing to peel until Lulu. I liked this one a lot. Stacey was a no-nonsense heroine. She was strong but I liked that she could be spontaneous too. Dex was a nice surprise and shame on those who didn't realize his potential. Another great thing was that we were able to see how the characters from the prior books were doing.",

    imageS: mrsleifSinopsis,
    sinopsis: "For fans of Mystic River by Dennis Lehane and Little Fires Everywhere by Celeste Ng, Stephen Amidon’s Locust Lane is a taut and utterly propulsive story about the search for justice and the fault lines of power and influence in a seemingly idyllic town. Can anyone be trusted? On the surface, Emerson, Massachusetts, is just like any other affluent New England suburb. But when a young woman is found dead in the nicest part of town, the powerful neighbors close ranks to keep their families safe. In this searing novel, Eden Perry’s death kicks off an investigation into the three teenagers who were partying with her that night, each a suspect. Hannah, a sweet girl with an unstable history. Jack, the popular kid with a mean streak. Christopher, an outsider desperate to fit in. Their parents, each with motivations of their own, only complicate the picture: they will do anything to protect their children, even at the others’ expense. With a brilliantly woven, intricately crafted plot that gathers momentum on every page, this is superb storytelling told in terse prose—a dynamic read that is both intensely gripping and deeply affecting.",
    imageR: mrsleifReview,
    review: "I have mixed feelings about this one. It was a slow-burn novel that kept me interested but the ending lost me, so a three-star rating is where this one falls for me. Welcome to Emerson where money talks and using privilege can always keep you on top! Eden Perry, a teenager has been found dead. She was known to be difficult although before she was murdered, she had started turning her life around. She had moved in with family members who were helping her since she couldn't see eye to eye with her mother. The last people who saw her alive were three teenagers: Hannah, Christopher, and Jack. Jack came from a rich family and he believed everything was owed to him. Hannah was Jack's girlfriend and she was willing to do anything for him. Last, there is Christopher, the son of a local chef who becomes the prime suspect. The parents of all three teenagers in one way or another will interfere with the investigation. What I disliked included the portrayal of the cops with a one-track mind, one-dimensional to say the least. And as I mentioned earlier, I didn't like the ending. It was quite depressing. What I enjoyed was getting to know the darkest part of these characters. No one was completely innocent. They all had shades of darkness. The narrator, Cassandra Campbell, did a wonderful job of bringing them to life. ",

    sinopsis: "One year ago, Isabelle Drake's life changed forever: her toddler son, Mason, was taken out of his crib in the middle of the night while she and her husband were asleep in the next room. With little evidence and few leads for the police to chase, the case quickly went cold. However, Isabelle cannot rest until Mason is returned to her—literally. Except for the occasional catnap or small blackout where she loses track of time, she hasn’t slept in a year. Isabelle's entire existence now revolves around finding him, but she knows she can’t go on this way forever. In hopes of jarring loose a new witness or buried clue, she agrees to be interviewed by a true-crime podcaster—but his interest in Isabelle's past makes her nervous. His incessant questioning paired with her severe insomnia has brought up uncomfortable memories from her own childhood, making Isabelle start to doubt her recollection of the night of Mason’s disappearance, as well as second-guess who she can trust... including herself. But she is determined to figure out the truth no matter where it leads.",
    imageR: mrsleifReview,
    review: "A great story! Isabelle Drake has not had a good night's sleep in almost a year. Her insomnia started after her two-year-old son, Mason was taken from his bedroom while she and Ben, her husband were sleeping in the room next door. Ben left Isabelle about six months after Mason disappeared. He is ready to move on with another younger version of Isabelle. Isabelle can't understand how Ben is already ready to give up while she is the complete opposite. Her son is on her mind 24/7 and she even travels to true crime conventions to speak about what happened to her in hope that someone can help her find him.  At the end of the latest convention, she meets a podcaster by the name of Waylon. He wants to interview her about her son's abduction. At first, she doesn't want to but then she agrees.  As she meets with him, she starts remembering things from her past that scare her. Could she have hurt her child? This audio narrator, Karissa Vacker was fantastic. The development of the story had me on the edge of my seat. I was able to guess a couple of twists but not all of them. This was great! I can't wait to read another book by Stacy Willingham.",

There’s a series of women going missing, and Sunny feels powerless to stop it. There’s her persistent and awesomely-rebellious daughter Auri, who’s out to singlehandedly become Del Sol’s youngest and fiercest investigator. And then there’s drama with Levi Ravinder—the guy she’s loved and lusted after for years. The guy who might just be her one and only. The guy who comes from a family of disingenuous vipers looking to oust him—and Sunshine—for good.",

    review: "I do love this series! Throughout it, I either cracked a smile or laugh out loud! I will suggest reading this series in order to appreciate the storylines. A Hard Day for a Hangover begins as its name says. Sherriff Sunshine Vicram is experiencing a hangover after drinking too much the night before. The morning also brings a Jane Doe who has been left for dead and found on a side of a mountain. When she starts digging, it looks like more women have gone missing in the years prior. Sunshine's daughter Auri, is also interested in the case. She can't help herself from learning more about the case and doing a little bit of digging on her own. Auri's boyfriend is still recuperating from the events of book 2, but he is still very much present. Of course, Levi is also accounted for. Yes, someone might be trying to get rid of him but he is around to help both Sunshine and Auri. I'm quite invested in this series and I can't wait to read the next one. I hope the humor, the silliness, and the mysteries keep on coming.",

Twenty-two years ago, she and her two best friends, Cassidy and Olivia, spent the summer roaming the woods, imagining a world of ceremony and wonder. They called it the Goddess Game. The summer ended suddenly when Naomi was attacked. Miraculously, she survived her seventeen stab wounds and lived to identify the man who had hurt her. The girls’ testimony put away a serial killer, wanted for murdering six women. They were heroes. And they were liars. For decades, the friends have kept a secret worth killing for. But now Olivia wants to tell, and Naomi sets out to find out what really happened in the woods—no matter how dangerous the truth turns out to be.",
    imageR: mrsleifReview,
    review: "The narrator of this audio, Karissa Vacker, did a fantastic job! What Lies in the Woods starts slow but picks up just at the right time. Three friends share a common past. At eleven, Cassidy, Olivia, and Naomi were best friends. They were always together despite coming from different upbringings. Naomi's home life was not easy. Her father an alcoholic and hoarder didn't help her situation. In order to escape, she was more than willing to follow the games her friend, Cassidy created. This time the game is called The Goddess game where they all thought of themselves as goddesses and had to do different rituals in the woods. This is where they find a secret that they keep for twenty-five years. While in the woods one day and only with one ritual left, Naomi is attacked and stabbed seventeen times. Her two friends run for help just in time and Naomi survives. They testify against a man, presumed to be a serial killer and Naomi's testimony sent him to jail. However, 25 years later, Naomi still has doubts about the identity of her stabber. When she gets a call that he has died in prison, she decides to go back home to see her two friends. Liv is ready to share the secret they have kept for so long. The other two are not sure this is the right time especially when a podcaster is lurking around trying to get their story. What Lies in the Woods was quite enjoyable. I had a few theories and a couple turn out to be right which didn't deter my entertainment. I like Naomi and she felt reliable (quite surprisingly in this genre).  The secrets and the whodunit kept my interest all the way through while the narration made it more real for me.",

And when Hannah wishes him luck after clearing up the confusion, she never actually expects to hear from him again. Then she gets a text saying he got the job and he'll be moving to London, and she can't help but smile.

    review: "So many feelings! A wrong phone call places two strangers in each other's orbit. Hannah is single and living in London. She is a young woman who is happy with her life, she spends time with her best friend and her friend's husband. Davey is British but he has been living in the USA since he was a child.

    sinopsis: "From the author of the New York Times bestseller The Last Flight comes a twisted con-woman thriller about two women out for revenge―or is it justice? Two women. Many aliases. Meg Williams. Maggie Littleton. Melody Wilde. Different names for the same person, depending on the town, depending on the job. She's a con artist who erases herself to become whoever you need her to be―a college student. A life coach. A real estate agent. Nothing about her is real. She slides alongside you and tells you exactly what you need to hear, and by the time she's done, you've likely lost everything. Kat Roberts has been waiting ten years for the woman who upended her life to return. And now that she has, Kat is determined to be the one to expose her. But as the two women grow closer, Kat's long-held assumptions begin to crumble, leaving Kat to wonder who Meg's true target is. The Lies I Tell is a twisted domestic thriller that dives deep into the psyches and motivations of two women and their unwavering quest to seek justice for the past and rewrite the future.",

She lives with her fiancee and writes for a magazine. In theory, these women don't have anything in common but Kat has been waiting for ten years to bring Meg down and for people to learn what a criminal she really is.  Kat wants revenge. So how can Kat learn what Meg is really doing back? She befriends her of course.  But the closer she gets to Meg, a different woman begins to emerge from what she thought she knew. Is this the true Meg or is she getting lied to? I was hooked from the first chapter and I was very pleased with its development. From the first moment, I started to root for Meg to get away with whatever plan she had. It took me longer to like Kat. I can wait for Julie Clark's next book.",

When Amos Decker and his FBI colleague Alex Jamison are called to London, North Dakota, they instantly sense that the thriving fracking town is ripe for trouble. The promise of a second gold rush has attracted an onslaught of newcomers all hoping for a windfall, and the community is growing faster than houses can be built. The sudden boom has also brought a slew of problems with it, including drugs, property crimes, prostitution -- and now murder. Decker and Jamison are ordered to investigate the death of a young woman named Irene Cramer, whose body was expertly autopsied and then dumped in the open -- which is only the beginning of the oddities surrounding the case. As Decker and Jamison dig into Irene's life, they are shocked to discover that the woman who walked the streets by night as a prostitute was a teacher for a local religious sect by day -- a sect operating on land once owned by a mysterious government facility that looms over the entire community. London is a town replete with ruthless business owners, shady government officials, and religious outsiders, all determined to keep their secrets from coming out. When other murders occur, Decker will need all of his extraordinary memory and detective skills, and the assistance of a surprising ally, to root out a killer and the forces behind Cramer's death. . . before the boom town explodes.",

Their next case takes them to London, North Dakota where the fracking business is flourishing. A crime has been committed. A teacher by the name of Irene Cramer was found dead by a hunter. The murder plus the way her body was already autopsied is what makes the FBI start investigating. As the story progresses, it feels like Amos and Alex are ten steps behind whoever committed the crime. Luckily, they get help from a couple of special operatives that are watching their backs as the murder count continues to increase. I like the story and I like that Amos is starting to show more feelings and learning some social cues too. He makes a good team with Alex. I'm starting the next one right away.",

'We’re going to murder people who need to be murdered.' So begins a press release from a mysterious group known only as “The Five,” shortly after a vicious predator is murdered in San Francisco. The Five is made up of vigilante killers who are very bored…and very rich. They target the worst of society—rapists, murderers, and thieves—and then use their unlimited resources to offset the damage done by those who they’ve killed, donating untraceable Bitcoin to charities and victims via the dark net. The Five soon become popular figures in the media …though their motives may not be entirely pure. After The Five strike again in the Twin Cities, Virgil Flowers and Lucas Davenport are sent in to investigate. And they soon have their hands full--the killings are smart and carefully choreographed, and with no apparent direct connection to the victims, the killers are virtually untraceable. But if anyone can destroy this group, it will be the dynamic team of Davenport and Flowers.",

This group is targeting individuals to kill them and later on they brag about it. Thankfully, Lucas is not alone, he has Virgil Flowers with him. I haven't read Virgil's series but he has been in enough of the Prey series, that I already know I like him. As always there is a sense of urgency to stop them before one more dead body is found while still delivering good humor and an interesting resolution. If I have one complaint it will be politics getting more pages in this book than priors. As a rule, I don't like politics in my fiction. There is already enough of it on the news, social media, etc. ",
